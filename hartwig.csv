1,1,White,e4 e5,
1,2,Black,f4 Bc5,
1,3,White,Nf3 d6,
1,4,Black,Nc3 Nc6,
1,5,White,Bb5 Bg4,"The first four moves might be out of fashion, but this move is the first to seem slightly odd.  Clearly the bishop is best on c4; because white can, and eventually will probably exchange on e5, the bishop will support the rook on the open f-file bearing down on f7 (although it is a complication that white cannot castle to do this), and the bishop cannot be challenged by ...d5.  Instead of playing the most natural move, Alapin pursues a more concrete, but one-dimensional idea."
1,6,Black,d3 Ne7,"There are many ways to look at this move, which seems to be clearly best if less obvious than 6...Nf6.  I would like to see it as black's first ""reaction"" move, against the slightly odd 5.Bb5.  After black castles and eradicates the pin, this bishop essentially stops contributing to the fight for the center, since Bxc6 can be met with a recapture by the knight."
1,7,White,h3 Bxf3,
1,8,Black,Qxf3 O-O,
1,9,White,f5 Nd4,"In this game, it seems that every time white moves a pawn, it causes him trouble.  Here he returns the bishop pair (although it wasn't easy to see what to do with it) and takes the pressure off of the center, making it easier for black to play ...d5."
1,10,Black,Qg3 Nxb5,
1,11,White,Nxb5 f6,
1,12,Black,Be3 Bxe3,
1,13,White,Qxe3 d5,
1,14,Black,O-O c6,
1,15,White,Na3 Qb6,"This is a very ugly knight.  Besides that, the crux of black's advantage is that he has the lever to open the d-file WHEN HE IS READY TO DO SO, by way of which he takes over the game."
1,16,Black,Qxb6 axb6,
1,17,White,c3 Rfd8,"Of course the a8-rook, since it is doing something where it is, should be the last to move."
1,18,Black,Rf2 Rd7,And this is the key; black is able to take over the d-file because of his pawn lever.
1,19,White,Nc2 Rad8,
1,20,Black,Re1 dxe4,
1,21,White,dxe4 Nc8,"And this can be seen as the second ""reaction move"".  Because 17.c3 created weaknesses on a4 and c4, black prepares to bring his knight within reach of those squares."
1,22,Black,Rfe2 b5,
1,23,White,Na1 Nb6,
1,24,Black,Nb3 Na4,
1,25,White,Kf2 c5,
1,26,Black,Rc2 g6,"Everything was going nicely on the queenside; black has a grip on the d-file and a very bothersome knight while white's pieces just look jumbled up, and suddenly Rubinstein makes a move on the side of the board we had forgotten all about.  It seemed he wasn't interested in playing out ...c4 Nc1 on the board yet since it gives white information before black is ready to strike.  Instead, it's time to calmly improve matters some more, waiting for white to make more concessions before black REACTS.  And ...g6 fxg6 does improve matters because now black can create a passer at any moment with ...f5."
1,27,White,fxg6 hxg6,
1,28,Black,Nc1 c4,Now 29.b3 is met by 29...Nc5.
1,29,White,Ke3 Kf7,
1,30,Black,Rf1 Rd1,"Rubinstein seems to remove all of white's good pieces, while maintaining just enough material to win.  Now white has no chances to double on f6."
1,31,White,Rxd1 Rxd1,
1,32,Black,Ke2 Rd8,"Even now, the weaknesses of the queenside and the e4-square prevent white from challenging the d-file for several moves."
1,33,White,Ke3 Nc5,
1,34,Black,b3 Ke6,
1,35,White,bxc4 bxc4,
1,36,Black,Rb2 Rd1,"White goes for counterplay, but this also weakens his own defenses."
1,37,White,Rb6+ Kd7,
1,38,Black,Ne2 Kc7,An excellent tactical finnesse which forces the rook to give up ground.
1,39,White,Rb4 Rd3+,

1,50,Black,Ne2+ Kg4,
1,51,White,Rc8 Rf3+,"White is quite clearly lost, but a couple of variations are required to conclude that 51...Rf3+ was actually the most precise finish.  This was a tremendous game by black in every phase."

2,8,Black,Na3 b5,
2,9,White,Nd5 Be7,
2,10,Black,Bxf6 Bxf6,
2,11,White,c3 Ne7,"I have to admit that I'm not well-versed in the theory of this variation with 9.Nd5 instead of 9.Bxf6, but I know enough that this move causes me to sit up and pay attention. The idea of the 9.Nd5 line, as I understand it, is that black cannot get away with challenging the knight this easily. Presumably the kingside weaknesses are too much if black is also without his dark-squared bishop. But black says: ""show me""."
2,12,Black,Nxf6+ gxf6,
2,13,White,Bd3 Bb7,"The bishop often stays put for a long time in these lines, so this isn't an obvious case of ""finish development, get castled"",... especially if you see how white continues! Regarding development of the bishop to d3 in general - it is meant to be prophylactic, I think, against ...d5 and ...f5, but white has to show some care in that the bishop can find itself misplaced if black gets an opportunity to play ...f5 as a sac and then start rolling the center."
2,14,Black,Qe2 d5,"Keeping his castling options open, but soon he will have to choose and he will certainly go kingside..."
2,15,White,O-O-O Qc7,"Well I'll be damned! Actually, looking over this game a second time around, this seems very logical. If you read my notes to last week's game, you might even agree that this is a ""reaction"" move agaist 14...d5, the possibility of which white has cleverly kept open, but, but... the Na3 is supposed to go to the center, white is supposed to play a4 to activate the a1-rook, etc. Patterns can be useful, but they can be limiting as well. Apparently Nisipeanu is less susceptible to being limited by patterns than I am."
2,16,Black,Nc2 O-O-O,
2,17,White,exd5 Kb8,"Opening the center and preparing some exchanges. In general, white's advantage can be expected to grow as more pieces are exchanged, because his pawn structure is better. One possible modification to note, however, is that if white keeps the knights on the board, this may prove useful to tickle the weak a6 and c6 squares around black's king."
2,18,Black,Be4 f5,
2,19,White,d6 Rxd6,
2,20,Black,Bxb7 Kxb7,
2,21,White,Rxd6 Qxd6,
2,22,Black,Rd1 Qe6,
2,23,White,Nb4 Rc8,
2,24,Black,Qd3 e4,"I don't like this move. Black almost forces white to penetrate into the position, which he was probably intending anyway. In black's defense, it takes some calculation to see how bad this actually is."
2,25,White,Qd7+ Rc7,
2,26,Black,Qxe6 fxe6,
2,27,White,Rd6 a5,
2,28,Black,Na6 Rc6,"The second move from white in this game to take me completely by surprise. The a6-square seems remote and unlikely, not least because the knight is nearly trapped there. For these reasons I would be tempted not to look at it at all. But after you see it, it becomes clear that 28. Na6 is the winning move, since in this case white's rook penetrates and becomes unanswerable after the slightly tricky knight exchange."
2,29,White,Rd7+ Kxa6,
2,30,Black,Rxe7 b4,
2,31,White,Kc2 a4,
2,32,Black,Rxh7 a3,"And now it is merely a ""matter of technique""."

2,39,White,h5 Rd8,Nothing helped.
2,40,Black, h6,
3,1,White,d4 Nf6,
3,2,Black,Nf3 c5,"This could be just a move-order trick, or a signal that white is going to play one of the systems without c2-c4, for example the Torre (3.Bg5) or the Zukertort (3.e3, 4. Bd3, 5. b3,...). As a generality, if white is just going to play c4 later, I think this move loses more flexibility than it gains.  However, once you know your own and your opponent's repertoire this may not be the case. For example black cannot get a Benko proper now if white doesn't want to co-operate. This may have been what black had in mind, because he isn't happy to let white transpose to one of various standard openings, so the game goes down a relatively original path."
3,3,White,d5 b5,"Bravo! This is the ""I'm not going to let you get back into a normal opening"" move."
3,4,Black,Bg5 Ne4,
3,5,White,Bf4 Bb7,
3,6,Black,a4 Qa5+,"A thematic looking idea which doesn't work, but Hebden's continuation was not so easy to foresee. It takes a lot of courage to explore these variations that are off the beaten track, and for that Degraeve gets my respect. I remember annotating some of my own games a couple years ago that reached distinctly messy positions, and it was incredible to me how many mistakes and outright blunders were made in such games. Even 450 points up the rating ladder, I suspect that it isn't easy."
3,7,White,Nbd2 Bxd5,
3,8,Black,axb5 Qd8,
3,9,White,Ra4 Nxd2,"This is the sting. Without this move, black is behind in development, but had good prospects with a grip on the center, and a better pawn structure. Now he is losing the fight in the center, coming under pressure on the queenside, falls further begind in development (e4 hitting the bishop), and is fighting to stay alive."
3,10,Black,Nxd2 d6,
3,11,White,e4 Bb7,
3,12,Black,Qa1 e5,"There is no way to defend a7, so white has a big advantage after only 12 moves. Impressive, but now black digs in."
3,13,White,Bg5 Be7,"A very nice shot, but 13. Be3 was also strong, when there remains nothing for black to do to avoid 14. Rxa7."
3,14,Black,Bxe7 Kxe7,"Both sides splay some originality this game. In this case it all comes to a disappointment for black, but 14...Kxe7, increasing co-ordination along the back rank, is nonetheless a nice motif to remember. 14...Qxe7 15.Rxa7 was simply losing, but now he is ready to meet 15.Rxa7 with 15...Nd7 and 16...Nb6.  Of course white is still much better here and black doesn't have any active compensation for the pawn, but the extra pawn is on the queenside where black has a sturdy blockade, and he just might be able to hold."
3,15,White,Bd3 Nd7,
3,16,Black,O-O Qb8,"An interesting moment, which brings up the point that it doesn't always pay to be super-sophisticated. Instead of taking the pawn, white prefers to triple pieces on the a-file and simply maintain the pressure. In some ways leaving black's pawn on the board doesn't make his position any easier to play, but I wonder nonetheless, did Hebden just assume he could triple pieces and pick up the a7-pawn at his leisure? It turns out this isn't the case."
3,17,White,Qa2 Nb6,
3,18,Black,Ra5 Qc7,
3,19,White,Ra1 Rhd8,
3,20,Black,Bc4 Kf8,"It isn't possible for white to just win the pawn, for tactical reasons. Therefore he uses his pressure to regroup."
3,21,White,c3 h6,"The purpose of this move is not so easy to guess, even after you have seen it. What do you think?"
3,22,Black,Qb1 Bc8,Aha!
3,23,White,Qd3 Be6,
3,24,Black,Bd5 Bxd5,"After this move white completes the regrouping and gets his strong queenside pressure back. It seems like black should have a chance to recover after white shunned the a-pawn, and this looks like that one chance."

3,32,Black,b6 Qb7,
3,33,White,bxa7 Ra8,
3,34,Black,Rxd6 Qxb2,"Having seen the conclusion of the game, I can state here with relative confidence that white is winning, due to the d-pawn and the weakness of black's king. But I'm not sure that, given this position to look at, I would know anything beyond ""white is better"". What about you? Anyway, the rest of the game makes a lot of sense to me, which is not to diminish the fact that Hebden played it well, so the final commentary will be sparse."

I don't know if anybody still bothers to think about these things conceptually, but it has always helped me to remind myself at this point why I am sacking a pawn.  Right, it clears the 'b' and 'c' files and the h8-a1, h7-b1 diagonals, all of which lead to white's king.  Sounds good..."

Basically I had played this for a long time, and I had never gotten burnt, so I didn't see any reason to fix it.  For all I know however, this is the losing blunder according to Deeper Blue."

4,16,Black,Bd3 Rab8,
4,17,White,b3 Rfc8,"So far we had both used something like a minute, but I am almost sure that after this move black has inadequate compensation.  Sloppy preparation and sloppy form at the board (I should have slowed down and at least considered 17...Bxd3 at this point) cost me the game."
4,18,Black,Bxf5 gxf5,
4,19,White,Bd4 e5,"Here I rushed past another critical point.  It seemed to me that I had to force c2-c4 to have a chance attacking white's king, so I assumed that 19...Qc6 20.Qb2 was good for white."
4,20,Black,Bb2 Qc6,
4,21,White,c4 a5,"So I had forced c2-c4, developed my pieces, now what to do?  If things went ideally, now I would buckle down and find the winning combination.

Usually this indicates a big understanding difference between the opponents, but Beliavsky is a strong GM. What happened?... and this brings us to the second reason.  There is one move by black in this game that does not quite fit the ""smooth"" mold; it is absolutely dynamite.  If you are using Chessbase Reader to look at this game or something similar, put it into training mode.  I will warn you before the move you should try to guess."

14,10,Black,Nd2 Re8,Also a weird-looking move but you won't even glance twice if you've played through a lot of Benoni games. Playing the knight to c4 puts pressure on d6 and frees the path for the f-pawn.
14,11,White,f3 Nc7,
14,12,Black,a4 b6,"This might seem inconsistent with what I said earlier about ...b5, but black isn't changing his plans. Rather, he is just going to play ...Ba6 and exchange it off for something first."

14,18,Black,Bd3 c4,
14,19,White,Bc2 bxa4,"So far I have emphasized that black's play is thematic and typical.  This move, on the other hand, is shocking and brilliant.  I am not a strong enough player to guaranantee to you the move's objective value, but I can tell you this.  Creativity, and keeping your opponent off balance, wins games.  Outplaying a strong opponent like Beliavsky as completely as we shall see later is not possible if he can predict all of your moves.  So, from a pragmatic point of view, completely sound or not, look for something like this in all of your games, as it can be absolutely devastating."
14,20,Black,Bxa4 Nb5,This is the point.  By corrupting his pawn structure black brings the knight (which was doing nothing on c7) into the game.
14,21,White,Kh1 Qb7,
14,22,Black,Bxb5 axb5,This completely vindicates black's plan.  Now he has a good structure back and he has made significant progress.  The a-file is open and the formerly useless c7-knight has been exchanged.

After I had completed my notes, I got a copy of Ftacnik's notes for the Informator.  He basically had two interesting things to say.  One was regarding the move 21.Kh1, which he thinks is a mistake.  I have to admit that I don't really understand his analysis, as he seems to be assuming that in any case white must play Ba4xb5, which I didn't agree with.  The second thing that was really interesting was the suggestion of 19.Be2... What do you think is the idea of that move?  That's right, to prevent 19...bxa4!  After the brilliant 19...bxa4 has been discovered, somebody finds 19.Be2, invents a logical explanation which is condensed to one sentence (if you're lucky) in the opening monographs to save space, and theory moves on.  No wonder it is so hard to understand!  The lesson is to look for the games behind the moves, and be reluctant to just accept that one-sentence explanation and be denied the pleasure of discovering what is really, actually going on with 19.Bc2."

Therefore, at first I naturally assumed that white had something.  But I can't find it!  The computers are very powerful advocates for concrete variations over generalities, and they tenaciously find resources for the material grabber.
