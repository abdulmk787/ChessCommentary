1,1,White,e4 e6,"Now, along with Pe4 there is an indication Black will place pawns on light-color squares to prevent Bf1 from ever being dangerous. White will probably have to meet 2...d5 with e4-e5 to open the d3-h7 diagonal. So, White needs a Pd4 to support Pe5."
1,2,Black,d4 d5,
1,3,White,Nc3 Bb4,"Winawer Variation -- by pinning Nc3 Black keeps Nc3 awkward. It does, however, give White time for e4-e5."
1,4,Black,e5 c5,"Black attacks in a most natural way, though he does leave Pg7 exposed for the moment."
1,5,White,a3 Bxc3+,This is a saving grace which helps White straighten-out his queen-side a bit.
1,6,Black,bxc3 Ne7,"After this it's clear White has to attack at the base of Black's pawn chain (Pf7, g7, h7) and Black can attack Pc2, Pc3 & Pd4; but both will also be keeping their eyes on the opponent's king, hoping to ensnare him in an attack."
1,7,White,Qg4 O-O,"For a time this was considered bad, but has recently made a come-back. The king seems a little out of place (unlike after ...O-O-O) , but with ...f7-f5 he's been able to slow White's attacks."
1,8,Black,Bd3 f5,
1,9,White,exf6 Rxf6,"Black hasn't blocked-out Bd3, but has more room for his pieces to defend Kg8. The backward Pe6 is hardly of importance when a king's safety is at stake. There is even the possibility of ...e6-e5 (discovering an attack on Qg4) and then ...e5-e4 to block out Bd3."
1,10,Black,Bg5 Rf7,
1,11,White,Qh5 g6,this secures Ph7 and may serve to provide a support for ...Ne7-f5
1,12,Black,Qd1 Nbc6,"Although he could have played 12. Qh4 I think he might have had it in mind to play h2-h4-h5xg6 to continue the attack on Kg8. In any event after Qd8 moves Black would have ...Ne7-f5, so Qd1 is safer."
1,13,White,Nf3 Qf8,"It seems to me this is the moment for Black to define (and begin) his middle-game plan. To develop Bc8-d7 isn't much: ideally Black could now (without White's Pe5) aim for ...e6-e5 when Bc8 could develop to g4 or f5. So, 13...c4 14. Be2 Qd6 might be a good start. If one doesn't like ...c5-c4 then 13...Qd6 could still be played. White can't fight for square e5 so easily."
1,14,Black,O-O c4,
1,15,White,Be2 h6,further weakening the king's position seems unnecessary.
1,16,Black,Bc1 Bd7,
1,17,White,Ne1 g5,"I'm told this is a novelty, which means all which preceded it had been played before. This amazes me because it seems to me Black's play was far from perfect."
1,18,Black,g3 Nf5,"While Black is moving the pawns in front of his king White aims to control f4, leaving Black's center and king weak. Those two factors (if achieved by White) could lead to a won position."
1,19,White,Ng2 Qg7,
1,20,Black,f4 Nd6,
1,21,White,Qe1 b5,"White might have found it useful to play a3-a4, but Black uses Pb5 to bind Pa3 & Pc3 which blocks Bc1 and Ra1. This isn't essential to a resolution of the pressures on Pf4, but it could contribute to the pressure on Ponomariov to find his way."
1,22,Black,fxg5 Rxf1+,"Ponomariov prefers to simplify the position; rightly so I think. His pieces need room to fight, before Black gets in ...e6-e5."
1,23,White,Bxf1 hxg5,
1,24,Black,Ne3 Rf8,
1,25,White,Bg2 a5,
1,26,Black,Bd2 Qg6,
1,27,White,Ng4 Rf5,"Since Black can't play ...e6-e5 this rook move doesn't help much. Better is to stir up trouble all across the board by breaking through White's ""strong"" dark squares with ...b5-b4."
1,28,Black,Qe3 Kg7,
1,29,White,Rb1 Kh7,
1,30,Black,a4 bxa4,"Now it's White who controls b5! An invasion by the White rook could help win the game. One curious thing about this move is that, despite it being White who is forcing matters, Black can benefit to some extent by capturing the gambit pawn and advancing it."
1,31,White,Bc1 Rf7,
1,32,Black,Ba3 Qxc2,"It's not so easy to see, but this backfires on Black. Had it worked to achieve a victory or draw then we might have to reconsider the notation (""?!"") . Black is trying to achieve, despite unorthodox means, the primary offensive plan -- to bash White's queen-side and, since White's king remains safe, to advance a pawn to promotion. Considering the alternatives this seems a reasonable try; and by doing so he distracts White, to some extent, from his king-side plans."
1,33,White,Rc1 Qf5,
1,34,Black,Bh3 Ne4,White threatens Nd6 and to move Ng4-e5.
1,35,White,Ne5 Qf2+,
1,36,Black,Qxf2 Rxf2,
1,37,White,Nxd7 Ra2,"Black's combination allows the ""bad"" Bd7 to be traded-off, so he has Rf2 and Ne4 activated, but at a cost. The question now is whether White can neutralize Ne4 & Rf2. To that end Nd7-c5 is in the offing. There may also be an opportunity for Bh3xe6."
1,38,Black,Bc5 Nd2,
1,39,White,Bg2 a3,
1,40,Black,Nf8+ Kh6,"Black needs one or two very valuable tempi for his plan to advance Pa3. What can White do in the meantime, nothing except capture Pe6; unless Black puts his king in a dangerous spot!"
1,41,White,Re1 e5,"White is looking for moves which capture material AND check Black's king. This is to gain time for clearing the board of Black pawns. He'll probably have to gambit Bc5xa3 to get rid of that one. Bg2 is purely for defensive work at the moment, but if Pe6 disappears Bxd5 could also become useful."
1,42,Black,dxe5 g4,
1,43,White,e6 Nf3+,moving off a square where Black's Nc6 could sacrifice itself desperado-style
1,44,Black,Bxf3 gxf3,
1,45,White, Kf1,"It looks complicated enough to continue, though White clearly has the upper hand with Pa3 already attacked and Pe6 prepared to advance. White only needs to gobble up a bunch of pawns, so his knight & rook could win an ending without being distracted by Black pawns on the queen-side."
2,1,White,e4 c5,
2,2,Black,Nf3 e6,"It could be argued the ideal pawn formation for Black is with ...d7-d6 and ...g7-g6 as in a Dragon or with ...e7-e6 and ...b7-b6 as in a Queen's Indian Defense. Both and everything else between are played. I've played the Najdorf and Scheveningen variations, but can easily see the advantages of the Dragon too. I haven't been too fond of 2...e6 because there's no added control of square e5, but that doesn't mean Black can't play ...Ng8-f6. 2...e6 serves a similar purpose to 1...e6 in a French Defense. It limits the scope of Bf1 and frees the way for Bf8 to develop."
2,3,White,d4 cxd4,"In this Sicilian Variation Black grabs the d-pawn before it can ever serve to support e4-e5. Now, usually, White must use f2-f4 to support the e4-e5 advance. But, that isn't the only plan White can utilize. Instead White aims for general piece activity and freedom of movement to hit Black wherever he can."
2,4,Black,Nxd4 Nc6,
2,5,White,Nc3 Qc7,
2,6,Black,Be2 a6,Black's pawns limit White's knights and Be2. Black seeks to keep open options while discouraging White from any active operations.
2,7,White,O-O Nf6,"This normal developing move creates an interesting threat: ...Bf8-b4xc3 and ...Nf6xe4. White tends to disregard this as a threat, to some extent, because the weakening of Black's dark squares is compensation for doubled c-file pawns. However, the loss of Pe4 requires more compensation."
2,8,Black,Be3 Bb4,
2,9,White,Na4 Be7,"This is a most unusual variation, not often played, but popular for a time in the 1980s. It was ""discussed"" several times in the Polugaevsky Memorial/Sicilian Love tournament, Buenos Aires 1994. White exploits the weak dark squares in exchange for Pe4. It might seem impossible, at this early stage, for this to be sufficient compensation for a pawn, but it has shown to be effective."
2,10,Black,Nxc6 bxc6,
2,11,White,Nb6 Rb8,
2,12,Black,Nxc8 Qxc8,"With 9...Be7 Black has threatened ...Rb8xb2, but left Pe4. White's two bishops and freedom of movement should give him some lasting advantage. Whether Black can utilize Nf6 with advancing central pawns, meant to block White's pieces, is unclear."
2,13,White,Bd4 O-O,
2,14,Black,Qd3 Qc7,
2,15,White,b3 a5,
2,16,Black,Rad1 d5,White threatens Bxf6 followed by Qxd7 and seems interested only in simple piece play -- tactical opportunism.
2,17,White,exd5 Nxd5,Black accepts that his pawns will be broken up and just improves the knight. From d5 it threatens ...Nd5-f4 to snare Be2 or ... Nd5-b4 to grab Pa2.
2,18,Black,Bf3 Rfd8,
2,19,White,c4 Nf6,Black obviously threatens ...c6-c5
2,20,Black,Qc3 Bd6,"It's amazing he'd offer to trade king-side pawns when Black's pawns are split, leaving Ph7 very weak."
2,21,White,g3 c5,"White simply defends his pawn and ""asks"" Black if he can manage to do as well."
2,22,Black,Bxf6 gxf6,
2,23,White,Qxf6 Be7,
2,24,Black,Qh6 Qe5,"White has won the pawn, weakened Ph7 and now plans Bf3-e4 (where else could the bishop be of use?) ."
2,25,White,Rde1 Qf6,White tries to get Bf3-e4 without allowing Black to undercut the effort by ...Rd8xd1.
2,26,Black,Qh5 Bf8,
2,27,White,Re4 Rd4,
2,28,Black,Rxd4 Qxd4,"preferring not to let White have a three-to-one queen-side pawn majority, even in exchange for a good passed central pawn"

2,34,Black,Rg6 Kh7,courageous or risky? White threatens Qh5xh6 or Rg6xe6 with Bf3-d5 to follow.

3,2,Black,Nc3 e5,"Kasparov has played the King's Indian Defense extensively, but not recently. He's also played the Gruenfeld Defense, but 2...d5 isn't considered all that good, so he finds another choice."
3,3,White,Nf3 Nc6,
3,4,Black,e4 Bb4,"Kasparov keeps the pressure on. This is usually intended to get rid of Nc3, so Black won't have to worry about Nc3-d5. However, in this position it threatens to undermine Pe4. That causes White to postpone d2-d4."
3,5,White,d3 d6,
3,6,Black,h3 O-O,"He seems intent on limiting Bc8, but in so doing sets up his own position as a target. It's already getting difficult to find a great plan for White. Expanding on the queen-side by a2-a3 would have to be prefaced with Bc1-d2 and Black could generate some king-side offense before that expansion ever becomes a threat. Essentially Black has three minor pieces ready to fight on the king-side (Nc6, Bc8, Nf6) , whereas White has two (Nf3 and Bc1) ."
3,7,White,Be2 Ne7,"He's apparently decided he can't play on the wing and must fight in the center with ...c7-c6, ...d6-d5, but to do that he has to reorganize a bit."
3,8,Black,O-O c6,
3,9,White,a3 Bxc3,
3,10,Black,bxc3 Ng6,"White will have use of the open file, but in an endgame, or late middle-game, his pawns might be targets. On the king-side White's pieces are pretty well situated to meet the oncoming attack, but can do nothing aggressive."
3,11,White,Re1 Re8,"This seems to indicate Kasparov is considering ...d6-d5, but one would think opening the center could only be good for White's bishops."
3,12,Black,Bf1 Bd7,
3,13,White,Qb3 Qc8,
3,14,Black,Rb1 b6,
3,15,White,Kh2 h6,"Kasparov is making useful moves, but without committing to a specific plan of offense. Perhaps there isn't one and he's just playing an equal position, in hopes his opponent will allow things to slip a bit."
3,16,Black,g3 Qc7,"This might appear to weaken Nf3, but with Bf1-g2 he shores up his king's position rather neatly. This is the kind of position he could've had straight away. Instead, it's taken him a few moves to get to this and Black is ahead in advancing a plan."
3,17,White,Bg2 Be6,
3,18,Black,Nd2 Rad8,
3,19,White,a4 d5,"Is White's position well-coordinated or a shambles? Neither I suppose, but Black's looks more robust and capable of handling a few line openings. Earlier I said ...d6-d5 would favor White's bishops, but now it's not so clear. Black's rooks would benefit from the d-file opening and Bc1 looks useless."
3,20,Black,a5 dxc4,White leaves the lines closed to keep Black's pieces from raging all over his pawns.
3,21,White,axb6 axb6,
3,22,Black,dxc4 Nd7,"Black quickly redistributes his pieces toward the queen-side. But, wasn't he ideally prepared for the ...d6-d5 push beforehand? This seems like overkill or overcaution perhaps."
3,23,White,Bf1 Ne7,"Now the Black rooks don't look so terrific. Only the more-or-less permanent White pawn structure problems seem to justify Black taking this time to maneuver. Of course, if White doesn't take advantage of this moment Black might well jump all over him. Bf1 is blocked. Bc1 is blocked. Nd2 is passive. Re1 is blocked and passive. Only Qb3 & Rb1 are doing something significant."
3,24,Black,Qc2 Nc8,
3,25,White,Nb3 c5,"effectively ""killing"" Nb3 and Bc1!"
3,26,Black,Be3 Nd6,
3,27,White,Nd2 Ra8,
3,28,Black,Ra1 f6,"He leaves square c6 open for the moment, hoping to maneuver a knight through there before Qc6."
3,29,White,Ra2 Rxa2,
3,30,Black,Qxa2 Nb8,"Apparently Kasparov intends ...Nb8-c6-a5 and possibly ...Qc7-f7 to threaten Pc4. So, Pb6 is a more proper target for White, than invading on the a-file."
3,31,White,f4 Nc6,Opening this second front when he's arguably positionally worse is dangerous.
3,32,Black,f5 Bf7,"By chasing the bishop onto f7 he prevents ...Qc7-f7. This keeps Pc4 safer. But, it also weakens White's king's safety."
3,33,White,g4 Na5,
3,34,Black,h4 Kf8,
3,35,White,g5 hxg5,
3,36,Black,hxg5 Ke7,
3,37,White,Kg1 Rh8,Kasparov takes advantage of the newly opened file. With time control nearing this could have a disastrous effect on his opponent's composure. There are many White weaknesses and only a limited number of pieces to defend.
3,38,Black,Bf2 Rh5,
3,39,White,Nf3 Qc6,
3,40,Black,Qc2 Bxc4,"It's hard to change gears and not follow through on a plan. And, in this case, it looks pretty good for Black."
3,41,White,Bg2 Nf7,"Going toward the king-side isn't necessary now. Kasparov is split between winning on the queen-side and bashing the exposed Kg1 (well at least it was a couple of moves ago) and this fragments his play. Sticking to winning on the queen-side, in this particular game, should be sufficient to win."
3,42,Black,Qd1 Bb3,
3,43,White,Nxe5 Bxd1,a very nifty tactical shot!
3,44,Black,Nxc6+ Nxc6,
3,45,White,Rxd1 Nxg5,"Kasparov has won a pawn, but his attack on Kg1 evaporated and White has the two bishops in a position which is rapidly opening up."
3,46,Black,Rb1 Nh3+,
3,47,White,Bxh3 Rxh3,
3,48,Black,Rxb6 Kd6,There goes the extra pawn.
3,49,White,Kg2 Rxc3,"After 50. Bg3+ Black's Pg7 might well fall, so they call it a draw; though Pc5 is still a threat and one could see Black fighting on. Kasparov was a bit unlucky to have only drawn. Most of the time he'd win that kind of game."
4,1,White,e4 e5,"Unlike a Sicilian or French Defense here Black firmly places a pawn in front of Pe4, and says ""no further"". White has tried some extreme measures, such as a King's Gambit, to get rid of Pe5, but the more common approach these days is to apply pressure to Black's position all over the board."
4,2,Black,Nf3 Nc6,
4,3,White,Bb5 Nf6,"This is the Berlin Defense. It's not been considered sufficient to achieve more than equality, but Kramnik used it very successfully against Kasparov in the Braingames World Championship match. Whether it's the appropriate ""weapon"" against Anand is questionable."
4,4,Black,O-O Nxe4,White offers Pe4 as a way of forcing open the e-file when White has castled and Black hasn't.
4,5,White,d4 Nd6,Forcing a resolution of the pressure this way is considered safest.
4,6,Black,Bxc6 dxc6,
4,7,White,dxe5 Nf5,
4,8,Black,Qxd8+ Kxd8,"This is the main advantage of 7. dxe5. It isn't so easy to clobber Ke8 with queens off the board, but White has an easier time developing and has a five to four king-side pawn majority. Black, on the other hand, has the two bishops."
4,9,White,Nc3 Ne7,"I suppose he is clearing the way for ...Bc8-f5, but those squares on the king-side in front are risky to occupy. White's pawns might race forward."
4,10,Black,Re1 h6,
4,11,White,h3 Ng6,
4,12,Black,Bd2 Bd7,"This is a modest move which leaves the bishop capable of moving to c3 to back up Pe5 or simply guarding square f4. One noticable key thing about the move is it doesn't weaken his queen-side the way the b2-b3, Bc1-b2 plan does."
4,13,White,Ne4 Kc8,"Black is far from completing his development, but if White doesn't execute a concrete attack he'll have time. That was the idea Kramnik utilized (as Black) to slow Kasparov."
4,14,Black,Ng3 c5,
4,15,White,Nh5 b5,This looks promising: he holds Bf8 in place.
4,16,Black,Nh2 Kb7,
4,17,White,f4 Nh4,
4,18,Black,Re2 Bc6,"now Re2 and Nh5 are aligned perfectly for a Bf3 to fork! All Black needs is for 19. g3 Nf3+ 20. Nxf3 Bxf3. Also, the d-file is cleared, so Ra8 can come into play."
4,19,White,c3 g6,
4,20,Black,Nf6 Be7,
4,21,White,Be1 Nf5,"Black would rather keep lines closed, at least until all his pieces are equal to White's. Then he might seek to open lines for his bishops."
4,22,Black,Ne4 Ng7,"Black is aware of the importance of White achieving f4-f5 to mobilize Pe5. It looks a little awkward, but White's maneuvers behind the pawns (Pe5 & Pf4) look a little awkward too."
4,23,White,Ng4 Rad8,
4,24,Black,Ngf2 h5,
4,25,White,Bd2 h4,by preventing g2-g3 he keeps Pe5 & Pf4 slightly weak and always in need of piece support
4,26,Black,Be3 Ne6,
4,27,White,Nf6 a5,
4,28,Black,N2e4 b4,
4,29,White,Ng5 Rd3,This is a strong indication Black has his king-side well organized for defense. If 30. Nxf7 Rf8 Black will regain the pawn by capturing at f6. This game is another indication of how difficult it can be to get at Black's thorny position.
5,1,White,d4 d5,"Despite Shirov's reputation he doesn't always play the most blood-thirsty unbalanced defenses. 1...d5 weakens e5, but directly aims to prevent White from gaining too much ground with c2-c4 and e2-e4."
5,2,Black,c4 c6,"Slav Defense -- It' a simple idea: to capture Pc4 and defend it with ...b7-b5. This requires White to pay attention to his weakness (Pc4) . Ideally, for Black, White would have to play e2-e3, blocking Bc1. The downside is that many of it's variations are quite drawish or difficult for Black to win. At the top level of competition it's enough to stop White and perhaps take the opponent away from the kind of game he wanted to play."
5,3,White,Nf3 Nf6,"Black hasn't yet moved Pe7, so there's no pin after Bc1-g5. That makes Black's army more mobile. And, the more developed he becomes the more likely ...dxc4 will succeed."
5,4,Black,Qc2 g6,This is a poor place for the queen. It weakens Pd4 and could easily become aligned with a ...Bc8-f5.

6,6,Black,Re1 b5,
6,7,White,Bb3 d6,"By defending Pe5 Black is free, if he were to choose, to play ...Nc6-a5xb3, so one often sees White move either his c- or a-file pawns to make room for the Bishop to retreat."

Why does Ivanchuk choose it for this game? One possibility is that he saw Vallejo Pons playing rather solid positions and ""offered"" a possibility of something more unbalanced and tactical."
8,2,Black,Nc3 e5,"And already White flinches from the main contest (2. e5) . With this I suspect both players are on their own (out of book) . With Nc3 White isn't able to support a d2-d4 with c2-c3, so f2-f4 is more likely. In that case the game could resemble a King's Gambit more than an Italian or Spanish Game."
8,3,White,Nf3 Nc6,"After Black's first-move provocation Vallejo Pons is proceeding very cautiously, perhaps even more than he might normally. Can Ivanchuk play aggressively to exploit that over-caution? How would he go about it? Oftentimes when one player doesn't use pawns much the other can overwhelm him with pawns. But, it depends upon the opening. Too much use of pawns in some openings just leads to difficulties."
8,4,Black,g3 Bc5,"After this it's quite possible Black will aim for ...Bh3 to trade-off Bg2, thereby weakening all the light squares on the king-side. Opening the center with ...d7-d5 would be unwise because it opens the diagonal for Bg2, making it stronger."
8,5,White,Bg2 d6,
8,6,Black,d3 a6,Ivanchuk clearly wants to keep Bc5 to keep control of d4 and perhaps to have a piece which reaches all the way to f2 (or g1) to threaten White's king. This extra pawn move seems justified.
8,7,White,h3 O-O,"The king-side seems the natural place for active play (for both White or Black) , so removing the king to the queen-side, where it's adequately defended by Bc5 and Nc6, should be safer and enables freer offensive actions on the king-side."

White holds the central files and Black has to use his long-distance pieces (queen and rooks) to work from the edges, hitting all the crucial points."

10,8,Black,Bxd2 Nf6,"I'm not certain I like this move, but ...Ng8-e7 has some problems too. Qd8 needs room to move, to give Ke8 an option to O-O-O.

12,3,White,Bg2 Bg7,
12,4,Black,O-O Nc6,"White waits to see how Black is organized before committing any pawns. But, does that gives Black time to make any White pawn move a bad one? With ...Nb8-c6 he makes d2-d4 impossible and c2-c4 weakens d4."
12,5,White,c3 d5,"This isn't so terrific. It's an indication Ivanchuk doesn't want to play a King's Indian Attack (5. d3) , but wants to fight Kasparov's pieces head-on. However, in this opening you can't always force such things without dire consequences. Nb1 won't be able to develop to c3 and Black is probably already equal."
12,6,Black,d4 cxd4,"In many of Kasparov's games an exposed Pc4, or in this case Pc5, has given him problems. His choice to exchange-off that pawn probably didn't take him long. It gives the c3 square back to White, so Nb1-c3 will be available. But, Black's Ng8 isn't required to develop to f6 to block Bg7 (as Nf3 does to Bg2) . It can develop Ng8-h6-f5 or with ...e7-e6, Ng8-e7 and Black's position will be very harmonious."

12,18,Black,Rdc1 Qe8,"This move is a bit hard to decipher. He might be intending ...f7-f5 to expand on the king-side, while threatening to open the f-file for a Black rook. But, on the c-file it looks like White might be able to force an opening and trade rooks."
12,19,White,Ne1 Nf6,
12,20,Black,f4 Kg8,"Ivanchuk beats Kasparov to the punch and makes his own king-side gesture. Of course there's no way to know, just yet, whether this could succeed or backfire.

12,21,White,Nd3 Bxd3,"With 17...Ng8 Kasparov seemed to be just maneuvering, but here he seems to be saying knights are much better than bishops in this kind of position (with this many pawns and few or no good open diagonals for a bishop) . Certainly e5 would be an excellent outpost square for a knight, so Nd3 had to be removed. On the other hand, White has good control of e4, so ...Nf6-e4 isn't going to be possible."

12,31,White,Qd3 h5,"As in his game with Villejo Pons, Kasparov sees an opportunity to open a second front, aimed at Kg1.

12,32,Black,Qe2 Qh8,
12,33,White,Kg2 Qh7,"What a horrible place for the queen. If White could simply lock up the king-side with g4-g5 and then force a quick opening of the c-file he might invade on the queen-side to win. But, Pe3 is weak and ...Ne7-f5xe3 is a serious threat. It's tempting."
12,34,Black, g5,"That puts an end to the second front. It gives up square f5, but that's of little concern compared to keeping Kg2 safe. This was an amazingly indirect maneuvering game. I haven't seen these two play this kind of game before. I suppose it shows they each have great respect for the other's tactical prowess. If anyone it was Ivanchuk, in the final position, who has the advantage!"

13,47,White, Bd8,"Black's queen-side pawns are blocked and his Kh6 can't be activated and Bc5 is just one piece which White can go around. White has a free king to attack Pf5 (and Kh6) or Pb6. This was a terrific, exciting, perhaps error-filled game; but it's one of the most interesting of the tournament. With this victory Kasparov moves into the lead."

14,6,Black,Ndb5 d6,"Sicilian Defense, Lasker-Pilnik or Sveshnikov Variation -- Black secures the dark squares and then begins to fight on the light squares. Whether he uses ...Bc8-e6 or ...a7-a6, ...b7-b5, ...Bc8-b7 depends in part on how White proceeds. Oh, and one musn't forget there is the Pelikan Gambit variation with ...d6-d5."
14,7,White,Bg5 a6,
14,8,Black,Na3 b5,This has become the most common move. Black takes away Na3-c4 or Bf1-c4 and threatens ...b5-b4.
14,9,White,Bxf6 gxf6,"But, Ivanchuk isn't avoiding doubled pawns; he might, after the closed maneuvering game against Kasparov in the previous round, relish the exciting fight which can sometimes ensue when Black uses his pawns aggressively to bludgeon White in the center. He may also think this is an ideal sort of opening and variation to use against Anand; hoping he (Anand) will lose his balance in the highly tactical lines which can arise. There are also times when Black can use the open g-file for offense."
14,10,Black,Nd5 f5,
14,11,White,c3 Bg7,Sometimes Bg7 is useful to enable ...Nc6-e7 to challenge the light squares.
14,12,Black,Bd3 Be6,perhaps dubious

14,14,Black,exf5 Bxd5,else Black can capture ...fxe4 and follow-up with ...f7-f5!
14,15,White,f6 h6,"Showing terrific confidence Ivanchuk doesn't try to block Bd3 just yet. He intends, I suppose, to use ...f7-f5 (a standard device in this opening) and leave Bd5 unblocked (by a Pe4) to attack Pa2 & Pg2."
14,16,Black,fxg7 Kxg7,
14,17,White,Nc2 Be6,
14,18,Black,Ne3 d5,Now Black can consider ...Qd8-g5 to defend Ph6 and force a queen trade. That would put an end to White's middle-game attack and force an ending favorable to Black.

14,48,Black,Kxd4 Rxb3,
14,49,White,Rg5 Rb4+,Anand is an excellent defender and this endgame demonstrated that skill. This was a very interesting game from a theoretical perspective too. Black had little difficulty gaining an equal or better position.
15,1,White,c4 e5,"In earlier rounds he has played 1. c4 against Kasparov (barely surviving) and 1. e4 against Ivanchuk (preferring a closed line with 2. Nc3 and g2-g3, Bf1-g2) . Apparently he believes it will be difficult for his opponents to come and get him if he maintains a safe position."

15,5,White,cxd5 Nxd5,
15,6,Black,Bg2 Nb6,"This kind of Reversed Sicilian Dragon, Classical Variation isn't too bad for Black. Black has played ...Nd5-b6 to avoid tactical difficulties. White threatened Nf3xe5 when Bg2 and Nc3 double attack Nd5. He'd also rather retreat than capture Nc3. Allowing White to open the b-file with 6...Nxc3? 7. bxc3 isn't very good for Black. Usually White (and possibly Black) has to play on the wing (White with a2-a3, b2-b4-b5 and Black with ...Bf8-e7, ...g7-g5-g4) to fight for central squares."
15,7,White,O-O Be7,
15,8,Black,a3 O-O,"White's quick queen-side threat (b2-b4-b5) prevented Black from getting to play his own ...g7-g5-g4, so Black simply castles and continues normally."
15,9,White,b4 Be6,
15,10,Black,Rb1 f6,
15,11,White,d3 Nd4,"This is a surprising move. Usually Black would avoid a trade of Nf3 in order to keep Bg2 under cover. But, in this case it appears Black intends to get his queen-side better organized before White could play Bc1-e3 and Nc3-e4-c5."
15,12,Black,Nd2 c6,
15,13,White,e3 Nb5,"again a curious choice. The knight has no better square, but it's odd to see Black allowing doubled pawns this way."
15,14,Black,Nxb5 cxb5,
15,15,White,Nb3 Na4,"Unfortunately for White he hasn't won a pawn, but does have a weak Pd3 and undeveloped Bc1."
15,16,Black,Bb2 Bd5,There were a number of interesting possibilities for Black. I don't know whether trading light square bishops is particularly useful for Black. Was Bg2 really that much of a problem?
15,17,White,e4 Bf7,Bg2 is blocked out of play for quite some time.
15,18,Black,d4 Rc8,"This seems to solve White's problems. The threat of d4-d5 to block Bf7 or the threat of d4xe5 should force Black to exchange pawns and that opens up the way for Bb2. Pe4 will still be blocking Bg2, but if square e5 opens then there's still a chance for e4-e5 to free that bishop too."
15,19,White,d5 Qd7,
15,20,Black,Qe2 Bd8,

15,29,White,Be2 Bg6,"White can't support Pe4 with f2-f3 because it's pinned and he won't want to move Nb3-d2 because that would allow ...Qc4-c1+, with further damage to follow."
15,30,Black,Qxc4 bxc4,
15,31,White,Bxc4 Bxe4,"Finally, after that phase the position opens a bit and it appears Black's pieces are a little better. Pe5 blunts Ba1 and Na4 & Bb6 restrain Nb3. So, Be4 and Bc4 duel. It appears to me Pd5 is exposed and weak, so ...Kg8-f8-e7-d6 would be an obvious continuation for Black."
15,32,Black,Nd2 Bf5,Even after this there's a threat of ...Kg8-d6 and ...Bf5-g6-f7xd5.
15,33,White,d6+ Kf8,
15,34,Black,Bd5 Bc8,This is a very nifty tactic as it attacks two Black pawns (Pb7 & Pa6) and opens the way for Nd2-c4. Black wasn't given any time to establish a bind by blockading Pd5 and now he even has to spend moves on defense.
15,35,White,d7 Bxd7,
15,36,Black,Bxb7 Bb5,"Time to re-evaluate: Pa6 is defended, but White has a two-to-one queen-side pawn majority. Fortunately for Black the pawns are blockaded and his king has approached the center, so that shouldn't be dangerous. White has a problem bishop (Ba1) , but even that may evaporate if White gets f2-f4 or Nd2-e4-c3. It's about as equal as can be."
15,37,White,Be4 h6,
15,38,Black,Bc2 Ke7,
15,39,White,Kg2 Bd4,"After this it is clearer that Black's king can't approach Pa3 because Bc2-b3, in particular, will chase him away. Nd2 helps secure square c4, so Black can't use Bb5 to worm his way in by opposing Bc2."

16,1,White,e4 e6,"Anand has played the French Defense a few times, though it doesn't really seem ideal for his style. His 3rd round game with Kasparov was a Sicilian, but one where he was hunkered down and counter-attacking. Perhaps that's just his mood for this game too. The French Defense is one of the ideal defenses for that attitude (Alekhine's Def. and the Pirc/Modern/Gurgenidze Def. being others) ."
16,2,Black,d4 d5,
16,3,White,Nd2 dxe4,"This indicates a desire for a simple game with many exchanges, leading to a draw. Various methods have been created for White, but none has been a sure-fire way of generating an advantage; the position is too open and with no serious weaknesses, except the difficulty Black has developing Bc8."

16,7,White,c3 c5,"I'm not sure why he'd give up on O-O-O so quickly. What's Black's threat? Yes, Pd4 needs defense, but even after Bf1-d3 it's fine."
16,8,Black,Be3 Qc7,"This is a very unusual square for the bishop; it's vulnerable to ...Nf6-d5 or ...Nf6-g4. But, moving Nf6 makes the a4-e8 diagonal even weaker."
16,9,White,Ne5 a6,"This prevents Bf1-b5, but not Qd1-a4+. It does force White to commit to one way of utilizing the queen, rather than waiting until Bb5+ forces Black into a rigid defensive position before Qd1-a4 or Qd1-f3 might win outright."
16,10,Black,Qa4+ Nd7,
16,11,White,O-O-O cxd4,"d4 becomes a crossroads square. White would like to have it open, so Rd1 can hit d7 and so Qa4 could move across to f4 (or g4) . But, Ne5 needs the support. White threatens Bf1-b5 to overwhelm Black's defenses at d7 and then using dxc5 to complete the crush. Black has to act fast to avoid all this."
16,12,Black,Nxd7 Qxd7,
16,13,White,Qc2 Bc5,"This is an interesting move since he could have immediately captured Pd4, allowing a queen trade. He could have also used 13. Qb3 to keep an eye on Pb7 and square d5 (though that doesn't necessarily prevent 13...Qd5) ."
16,14,Black,Bxd4 Bxd4,
16,15,White,Rxd4 Qc7,
16,16,Black,Bd3 Bd7,White's lead in development is significant and his Kc1 isn't terribly weakened by the early c2-c3.
16,17,White,g3 h6,I like this move. It blocks Qc7 and moves from a weak square (so Bd7-c6 can't threaten it) and might re-threaten Bxh7.
16,18,Black,Rd1 O-O-O,"Black seems to have all his ducks in a row, except his king is weaker than Kc1. There's only two pawns around Kc8 and they're already on light squares. This would make White think it's possible to consider a piece sac to expose Kc8."

16,25,White,Rxc6 bxc6,"One step closer to a draw because there's less material or one step closer to a win because there are many pawns and only one Black queen to defend them? I think the latter is likely -- especially since Pg7 and Ph6 aren't on secure squares (...g7-g6, ...h6-h5) ."
16,26,Black,h5 Kb7,"And, now they can't move at all!"
16,27,White,Kc2 f5,"I suppose Anand was tired of doing all the defending and feels it's his turn to do some offense. Of course, chess isn't that way. You sometimes just take what is served to you. 27...f5, by itself, isn't so bad. But, it indicates he wants more than to just connect the dots, defend everything, call it a draw and go home. It might be the first step toward a random outcome."

16,33,White,Qxh6 e4,

However, he had to have some idea of what he intended before he played Qh8 to capture Ph6. At e7 he guards square b4 to prevent Black's queen from perpetually checking along the b5-f1 diagonal."
16,42,Black,h6 c5,
16,43,White,Qe8+ Kc7,After Black's pawn move blocked the b4-e7 diagonal he had to switch to guarding b5 instead. Black has no perpetual check and Ph6 is impossible to stop.

17,10,Black,h3 Ng6,"This is a curious move. It threatens Pe5 which forces White, at least for the moment, to leave Nf3, which blocks Pf2 from advancing. Also, it prevents Bc1-f4 and clears the way for Bf8 to develop. I suppose Black decides how to develop his king-side pieces depending upon where White develops Bc1. If b2-b3, Bc1-b2 then Bf8 probably has to remain in place for a while to defend Pg7."
17,11,White,Bg5+ Ke8,
17,12,Black,Rad1 Be7,

17,26,Black,Kf4 Bb7,
17,27,White,c5 a3,
17,28,Black,b3 Ba6,"After this (good move) Black begins to envisage ...Nd4xb3; axb3 a3-a2; and ...Bb7-a6-d3-b1 to allow a2-a1=Q or if White has placed Rd1-a1 to trap it, so Ra8 can be unopposed. This plan is merely an idea at this point, and hardly enforcable, but something to work toward. White, will have to avoid that and still find a way to break through Black's queen-side; where he's been holding Black in place and now hopes to hit hard."
17,29,White,cxb6 cxb6,Black might use ...Nd4-e2+ to chase Kf4 back

19,5,White,c3 Nf6,"This is a typical, and necessary, response to White's effort to get the central pawn duo (Pe4 & Pd4) . Black continues developing, castles and hits Pe4 to force a resolution of the central pawns."
19,6,Black,Re1 O-O,
19,7,White,d4 cxd4,
19,8,Black,cxd4 d5,This is the usual solution: Black fixes White's pawns and then finds some way to chip into them to open the g7-a1 diagonal again.
19,9,White,e5 Ne4,This is risky. If Nf3 can move to allow f2-f3 then where would Ne4 run away to?
19,10,Black,Nc3 Bf5,"There are a couple of elements of this position which resemble a Slav, Exchange Variation. The main difference, of course, is the pawn at e5 rather than (say) e3. White's Bc1 can still develop freely and Bg7 is blocked, but Pd4 is also permanently weak."

19,12,Black,Bxc6 bxc6,
19,13,White,Na4 g5,"Yes, this is ugly, but it's the only way to force Nh4 back, block Pf2 and free Bg7. It doesn't appear to hurt the safety of Kg8 since there are several pieces around him to defend. There is, however, still a possibility of Ne4 becoming stuck, as in the Kasparov-Adams game (Petrov's Def.) where Black's Qe4 got stuck."

In this case Black has a bad weakness, but has also exchanged a couple of minor pieces, so that he's not terribly cramped. If Black had another weakness he might lose, but with only the one he's got a decent chance of drawing."
20,17,White,h3 h6,not very adventurous and it doesn't seem so necessary when both Black minor pieces are needed to guard square d5 -- there's no real threat of a Black incursion at g4

21,11,White,bxa3 d5,"This avoids any misplacing of Ra1 and he knows Pa4 can be exchanged-off, so he needn't worry about doubled pawns. The bigger question is whether this turns over control of the direction of the game to Black. How much can Black achieve now that he has a move to begin forcing events."
21,12,Black,exd5 Nxd5,"White naturally seeks simplifying exchanges now, and more open positions should be good for his bishops."
21,13,White,Bb2 Nf4,Black takes advantage of the moment and hops right in; this also opens the diagonal for Bb7.

22,8,Black,Nd5 Nf6,"After this White might intend Bc1-e3-b6 followed by Nd5-c7+. But, Black won't leave Nd5 unchallenged."
22,9,White,c4 b4,"This is different from the c2-c4 he played against Ponomariov. In this situation the pawn is almost assured of being exchanged for Pb5. In any case it makes sense to support Nd5 and doing it with this threat to Pb5 is useful. Of course, he had to calculate the effects of 9...Nxe4 10. cxb5 Qa5+."
22,10,Black,Nxf6+ Qxf6,Though this leaves d5 weak Black can use it as an opportunity to do some damage on the king-side; usually Black doesn't get the queen out in front until much later in the middle-game.

22,31,White, fxe4,"I suppose this might be an indicator that Shirov's 11...Qg6 was more dubious than good. These things are always easier to evaluate in hindsight. It also shows how dangerous either of these players can be, despite their inconsistency in this tournament."
23,1,White,d4 d5,Ponomariov generally plays either the King's Indian Defense or the Queen's Gambit Accepted against 1. d4.
23,2,Black,Nf3 Nf6,
23,3,White,c4 dxc4,To transpose to a Queen's Gambit Accepted at this point has it's interesting points. For one White can't continue with an immediate e2-e4. Black also doesn't have to worry about the double attack which would result from the move-sequence 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 a6 4. Bxc4 b5?? 5. Qf3 because there's a Nf3.
23,4,Black,Qa4+ Nc6,"Ponomariov is aiming for completely free and easy development with no pawn weaknesses. There is a similar variation in the Catalan opening, but in that one White gets in Nf3-e5xc6 to force tripled pawns on Black. Here White will have to develop solidly and yet threaten to meet such moves as ...e7-e5 with d4-d5 to cramp Black. The battle is on!"
23,5,White,Nc3 Nd5,This is sort of nifty. He's trying to get rid of a pair of minor pieces before White can utilize his extra central pawn to cramp him.
23,6,Black,Qxc4 Nb6,I don't understand. How could the knight be better on b6 than f6? Why not trade at c3?
23,7,White,Qb3 e5,Black isn't going to delay the development of his pieces! This takes unreal confidence or large doses of courage.

23,16,Black,a3 Bxc3,
23,17,White,Bxc3 Nxc3,
23,18,Black,bxc3 Rd5,"Ponomariov's strategy for this game seems to be eXtreme piece activity with very few pawn moves, giving Ivanchuk no time to use his pawns or to build up any kind of pressure. At the first sign of that sort of thing Ponomariov has gone for exchanges."
23,19,White,f4 Rc5,
23,20,Black, Rc1,"Ivanchuk could continue, despite this not being his kind of position, but it would be difficult to achieve anything, even if White gave back the pawn. Black's piece activity and immediate threats to Pa3 & Pc3 makes it difficult for White to make even one free offensive move. These two creep forward and are tied with Anand for 2nd-4th, now one full point behind Kasparov (who beat Vallejo Pons this round) ."
24,1,White,e4 c5,"I suppose it's ironic that Vallejo Pons should NOT play the Black side of a Spanish, Berlin Variation against Kasparov. Of all his opponents this one, who had such difficulty against that opening variation in his match with Kramnik, is the one he trusts will have something prepared, an improvement which might beat him."
24,2,Black,Nf3 e6,
24,3,White,d4 cxd4,
24,4,Black,Nxd4 a6,"Paulsen's idea was to delay committing pieces before limiting White's Nd4 and Bf1 and seeing how White develops his others. He would sometimes play ...d7-d6, Nb8-d7 and sometimes ...Qd8-c7 with ...Nb8-c6. More recently GM Taimanov of Russia has employed this kind of opening flexibility. The 4...a6 line carries Paulsen's name and 4...Nc6 carries Taimanov's name."
24,5,White,c4 Nf6,"Though this is an acceptable move I'm surprised to see Kasparov use it. He's hard to predict. Sometimes it's clear he has an idea he wants to try, other times he just seems to be preventing his opponent from playing from his home preparations. This kind of improvisation can stymie the opponent or backfire. Which will it be this time?"
24,6,Black,Nc3 Qc7,"There are good normal-looking development moves and there are plausible normal-looking, but bad moves. This move seems aimed at developing ...Nb8-c6 without an exchange forcing him to recapture with a pawn at c6. But, that completely disregards White's bold c2-c4 and the clamp on d5. Moving Qd8 off the file makes ...d7-d5 impossible. Not pinning Nc3 leaves Pe4 completely safe. I'd say it's usually not so terrific to play a Hedgehog formation, but against Kasparov it has to be bad; but that's what Black has to do now."
24,7,White,a3 b6,"Kasparov emphasizes his bind on the center and leaves Black to find some other way to break it open. The bad side of this move isn't so obvious, but with experience in Maroczy Bind positions (such as this) the pawns are better at a2 & b2 or a2 & b3. Once there's a pawn at a3 the queen-side is weaker and Black will threaten Pc4 as much as he can. If then b2-b3 defends Pa3 will be weaker."
24,8,Black,Be3 Bb7,With this it looks like Black is ready for ...d7-d5.
24,9,White,f3 Nc6,After this it's difficult for Black to get ...d7-d5.
24,10,Black,Be2 Rb8,
24,11,White,b4 Be7,"Though he's making a lot of pawn moves which Black should be able to counteract, he's playing to the idea which Black seems to be happy with, that there should be no quick break-out and Black should wait for a mistake or to find some weakness to counter-attack. But, Kasparov isn't going to give him anything once he gets developed; Black should fight back quicker, before White gets all his pieces active."
24,12,Black,O-O O-O,
24,13,White,Rc1 Ne5,"too late to create a serious threat to Pc4, but it's provocative. If White continues with f3-f4 there will be more room for Black to play (Pe4 will be weaker for one thing) ."
24,14,Black,f4 Ng6,
24,15,White,Bd3 Ba8,but not without some chances for Black to counter-attack. These positions can be very difficult to convert to victory because so much of the board comes into play.
24,16,Black,Qe2 Kh8,"I'm not sure why he doesn't commit to the direct e4-e5, but this move allows Rf1 to defend Rc1 and it takes aim at Pa6 as well as getting behind Pe4."
24,17,White,e5 Ng8,
24,18,Black,Qh5 a5,"Here's where White transitions from a nice solid position to an offense, and it's where Black counter-attacks to poke holes and generally make a mess of the whole board, as a way of distracting Kasparov from Kh8."
24,19,White,Ndb5 Qc6,"not only threatens checkmate at g2, it stays in touch with Pc4 to keep White under some pressure"
24,20,Black,Rc2 axb4,Why is he ignoring this possibility to play Rf1-f3?
24,21,White,axb4 Bxb4,
24,22,Black,Ne4 f5,It appears Kasparov is satisfied to keep Pc4 to restrain Pb6 (or Pd7) and Rc2 & Bd3 keep that structure solid. Meanwhile he'll swing several pieces to the king-side.
24,23,White,Ng5 Nh6,
24,24,Black,Kh1 Bc5,
24,25,White,Bc1 Qc8,"So, he seeks an endgame where he might finally utilize the pawn. This plan isn't so easily realized. Kasparov won't allow a queen trade if he can avoid it."

26,1,White,e4 e5,"Shirov almost exclusively plays 1. e4, but he played 1. d4 quite a lot in his youth. His book, Fire On Board actually has very few games with 1. e4. This game is very important to both players. Ivanchuk needs to win to keep a share of the lead and Shirov needs the win to get back in the race. He could climb out of the cellar and back to second place with a win."
26,2,Black,Nf3 Nc6,

26,11,White,c3 Na5,"This is a useful move for several purposes: one is to prevent ...Nc6-d4; another is to allow Qd1 to defend Pa4, so that after ...Nc6-a5 White can retreat Bb3-a2 (on the better diagonal) without losing Pa4. He may have some idea of playing d3-d4, but at the moment that would probably help Black more than White. White would rather maneuver Nd2-f1-g3 (defending Pe4 again) before committing to d3-d4 (which would weaken Pe4) ."
26,12,Black,Ba2 c5,"Apparently Ivanchuk feels he's put enough pressure on White's central pawns to keep them in place (as targets I suppose) and he secures that with Pc5. His next step would be to play more actively on the light squares. White is secure on the light squares, but might not have time to transition from that (a defensive duty) to something more aggressive."
26,13,White,d4 d6,"The glass shatters and White simply steps over it. He says there never was a ""bind"" or pressure."
26,14,Black,b4 exd4,Leave it to Ivanchuk to break all the rules and create something amazing like this. Is it good or just silly horrible? Nobody can know without playing it out.
26,15,White,bxa5 dxc3,"I suppose one of the key ideas is that Nd2 will now have to move and that gives Pe4 to Black. Pa5 might or might not be gathered-in as the game progresses. Anyway, the central Pe4 is much more important as it blocked Black's pieces."
26,16,Black,Nf1 Nxe4,"I'd generally want to put the ""biggest, most dangerous"" piece in front. In this case he may have felt it was simply unsafe to capture with the rook or bishop. But, if safe, either would be preferable to the knight."

It's easier to just figure out what to do next and do it. Clearly Black needs to get rid of Pa6, but not to allow his Kg8 to become mincemeat. It would be nice to play ...d6-d5, but Ne4xc3 just hops around knocking off one pawn after another."
26,23,White,Nxc3 Rxa6,

26,36,Black, Qxa1,"Wow! What a dramatic way for the game to end. This is one of the more interesting games so far in the tournament. I don't know if Ivanchuk lost by time forfeit, but the loss of Ra1 was probably enough to cause his capitulation. As a last-gasp effort I'd think 36...Re1 should be tried. If White responds with 37. Rc3 to remove the rook from danger and to over-protect Bc1 then he leaves himself open to 37...Qh1#. And, if Shirov played 37. Kg2 (leaving Rf3 pinned) Black could go ahead with a pawn push, hoping for a miracle comback. So, Ivanchuk climbs toward the top, now tied with Ponomariov and Anand, only one-half point behind Kasparov (though Ponomariov has already had his odd-man-out day off) ."

28,1,White,e4 c5,"I don't know how much fighting spirit is left in these two. They've both had their ups and downs and probably feel there's little chance to climb back into the fight for first place. Adams has played five decisive games, so there's no doubt any of his games might follow suit."
28,2,Black,Nf3 Nc6,
28,3,White,Bb5 e6,Shirov must suspect Adams has some improvement over the Kasparov-Shirov game or else he just wants to test Adams a bit by forcing him to find his own way.
28,4,Black,O-O Nge7,I like this move because it makes Bb5 less effective. It can't force doubled pawns by capturing Nc6.
28,5,White,c3 a6,
28,6,Black,Ba4 b5,Refusing to capture Nc6 leaves Ne7 awkwardly placed.
28,7,White,Bc2 Bb7,"This approach leaves the question of how Black will play Pd7 for later, but it also leaves Pe4 in place and gives White time for d2-d4, if he should so choose."
28,8,Black,Qe2 Ng6,"Clearly one of White's aims is to keep his pawns supported, so he can get in d2-d4 without a major disruption. How does Black prevent this ""obvious"" plan?"

28,12,Black,Bb1 Bd6,"The bishop may take an odd route (Bf8-d6-b8-a7) to find a weak White pawn it can target. This is the kind of contortions one has to endure when the opening play hasn't secured adequate space for the pieces. I suppose I should add, though it's guesswork, that Shirov may have played this way to provoke Adams into rash pawn moves which might weaken his position so that Shirov could counter-attack successfully. It's an odd thought though. Adams isn't known for doing anything rashly or out of control."
28,13,White,a4 bxa4,
28,14,Black,Rxa4 Nxf3+,
28,15,White,Nxf3 Nb4,"From here the knight defends Pa6 and keeps Ra4 inactive. After an e4-e5 it could go back ...Nb4-d5. However, it's tied to Bd6, so e4-e5 would shove ...Bd6-e7 which isn't a very active square for the bishop."
28,16,Black,Bd2 a5,"This secures Nb4, but it also forces Nb4 to remain because it defends Pa5 from Ra4 & Bd2. It also sneakily (perhaps by accident) threatens ...Bb7-a6!"
28,17,White,Rd1 O-O,
28,18,Black,Bc3 Qb6,"This isn't terribly appealing. The queen might be much more useful on the king-side, but he has to over-protect Nb4 to allow Bd6 to maneuver."
28,19,White,Ra1 Bf4,"Now it's clear Black is trying to box-in Qe2 and threatens ...Bb7-a6 to chase her back further. Black can't challenge Pd4 & Pe4, but he can play around them with good effect."
28,20,Black,Ne5 Qc7,
28,21,White,Qg4 Bxe5,
28,22,Black,dxe5 Bc6,"This creates a kind of wall on the e-file. Black's queen-side pieces will find it difficult to cross that wall to help defend Kg8. White might use Ra1-a3, Bc3-d4, Ra3-g3 to bring at least one more big piece to the king-side. There is also Bc3-d2-h6, but Pe5 needs defense."

Only if counter-play via the capture of e5 was going to be effective would White take the time to prevent it. In the final position Black can't do much. If 31...Bh5-g6 Rxh6+ forces mate and 31...g5 allows 32. Qf6+ and 33. Rxh5, winning the piece and/or checkmating. This has got to be one of the strangest tournaments for Adams. That's six decisive games out of ten!"

29,6,Black,O-O d6,White could play e4-e5 next.
29,7,White,c4 Be7,"Ivanchuk establishes the Maroczy Bind, as Kasparov did. Will Vallejo Pons have learned anything, so his result could be better this time? Already he has Pd6 to prevent e4-e5! I've seen a few games where Ivanchuk has done very well with this formation, so I wouldn't want to try the Black pieces against him."
29,8,Black,Nc3 O-O,"As in the game with Kasparov Black's position is relatively weakness-free. But, the most likely place for White to attack is at g7 or h7 and that places Black's king in danger. White, on the other hand, has no major weakness of a similar quality (Pc4, for example) ."
29,9,White,f4 Re8,In the game with Kasparov he had problems with the weakness of Pe6 after he fianchettoed ...Bc8-b7. This time he prepares to have it nicely defended. I suspect Ivanchuk would only begin to look at Pf7 as another weak spot to include in his offensive plans.
29,10,Black,Kh1 Nbd7,
29,11,White,Qe2 g6,"It's amazing how a move like this can be appealing and yet it weakens Nf6 quite a lot. And, after f4-f5 (whenever White chooses to play it) open lines would soon follow."
29,12,Black,Bd2 Bf8,"This is a tepid move, but he is gradually mobilizing his pieces while keeping an eye on Black's formation and where he will need to focus his attention. Right now it looks like e4-e5 or f4-f5, but there's also a possibility of moving heavy pieces onto the h-file."
29,13,White,Rad1 Nh5,In his 9th round game (Vallejo Pons - Anand) he had to meet an f-file attack against his castled king and Nf3-h4 was played to gain space for f2-f4. Is he replaying that game or does he have some original idea here?
29,14,Black,Nf3 b6,"Ivanchuk doesn't appear to be in a hurry, but he's not going to allow ...Qd8-h4 either. He's incidentally (?) clearing the d-file and may plan Bd2-e3-d4. This is an amazingly quiet maneuvering noncomittal game for Ivanchuk."
29,15,White,e5 Bb7,"Now the flood gates open and Black has Nd7 and Nh5 and Re8 developed. Most of his pieces are passively on the back rank. That's not to say this will be a crush, but White clearly has an advantage."
29,16,Black,Ng5 Ng7,"Now Pd6, Pf7 and Ph7 are all threatened. It's no coincidence."
29,17,White,Be4 Qc7,"Since the bishop is blocked by Pg6 he decides to trade it for Bb7, so he might use square e4 for another piece. This move also continues to clear the d-file."
29,18,Black,Qf3 Bxe4,
29,19,White,Ncxe4 h6,
29,20,Black,exd6 Qd8,I wonder why he'd give up the pawn so readily.
29,21,White,Qh3 hxg5,
29,22,Black,fxg5 e5,
29,23,White, Qxd7,"The bad news is that the attack doesn't end. The f-file is open and Ne4 has good control of f6 and the h-file is open, so Kg8 still isn't safe after a queen trade. I suppose his worst frustration is that he's given a pawn and hoped to keep some material edge as compensation for his positional woes, but now he's just behind material and position. One of the things I liked most about this game is that Ivanchuk didn't force much. He let Vallejo Pons strangle on his own inability to develop and maneuver properly. Ivanchuk just kept flexible and attacked when he had specific targets and all his pieces involved. Chess looks so easy sometimes."

30,3,White,d4 cxd4,
30,4,Black,Nxd4 Nf6,
30,5,White,Nc3 a6,"It's rather amazing to me that this opening variation should continue to be the primary defense of many top GMs. It was invented in the 1950s by Najdorf (originally of Poland, but after World War II of Argentina) and fought over throughout the 1960s and 70s. Bobby Fischer utilized it and honed it like a knife. Many years later, after other defenses have been tried and many discarded, this is Kasparov's favorite. It's interesting also to note that there are a zillion 6th moves White can choose from, and the one played most these days by the top GMs is 6. Be3, a move (and system) created by GM Robert Byrne, a New Yorker who was a childhood (and perhaps lifelong) friend of Bobby Fischer. Did he invent this opening variation to combat Fischer? I don't know. It was taken up by Englishmen and made more popular in the 1980s and 90s. Now it's commonplace."
30,6,Black,Be3 e5,"Particularly against 6. Be2 this move (6...e5) was Fischer's response. It is named for Opocensky, but like many variations, Fischer played it a lot and made it popular. It makes sense that as White he'd play 6. Bc4 if he thought Black might play 6...e5, leaving the c4-f7 diagonal open."
30,7,White,Nb3 Be6,"Now there are a couple of weaknesses in Black's pawn structure, so White will have a clear idea of where to play (d5, d6, b6) . However, Pe5 controls d4 and with ...Bc8-e6 Black controls d5 pretty well too. Only Bf8 will be noticably bad."
30,8,Black,f3 Nbd7,There's no immediate need for this. He wants to play g2-g4-g5 to gain better control of d5. Playing Qd1-d2 is mainly to prepare O-O-O and I guess he doesn't want to commit to that yet.

After the king-side pawns advanced he wouldn't be expected to O-O, though he might play Ke1-f2. With Black's queen-side pawns far advanced it's highly unlikely he'll O-O-O. On the other hand, Black's king seems perfectly safe, but Rh8 is going to be out of play if Ke8 stays in the middle of that rank."

30,28,Black,Qd3 Qxd3,
30,29,White,Rxd3 f4,"It might be a little odd for this to be Black's only tactic, but Rh8 is still well stuck behind Ph7 and Nd5 is proving to be strong enough and White's king's position is plenty safe."

30,38,Black,Rg3 Kf5,
30,39,White,Kd1 Bc7,"Their repetition of moves near the end could well have been due to time pressure. White might be better, but his pawns are weak (all of them) and Black's pieces are very well placed to capitalize on even the smallest misstep, such as 40. Rh3 Bf4, winning Bd2. Instead White has to prevent ...Bc7-f4 by 40. Rg4 Rxf3. This takes the game off in an altogether different direction."
31,1,White,Nf3 Nf6,"He varies from 1. c4, perhaps because he thinks his opponents are now focusing on him and finding particular plans to defeat him, rather than taking him for granted. He might just be tired (for the moment) of his usual opening."
31,2,Black,c4 e6,"This move continues to hide Black's intentions, to a certain extent. Often it's played like a Nimzo-Indian Defense, so that 3. Nc3 Bb4 helps Black fight for control of d5 and e4. To achieve the same end he might continue with the direct and classical ...d7-d5 or with a more modern Queen's Indian Defense (...b7-b6, ...Bc8-b7) . There are also other approaches: something completely different like ...c7-c5, delaying the development of Bc8 until he has ...Nb8-c6. To add to the confusion there is also a possibility of a Benoni Defense (3. d4 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6) when Black fianchettoes the dark-square bishop after all. It's potentially quite confusing."
31,3,White,Nc3 c5,"Black has had good success with this, with GM Nick DeFirmian as one of it's best proponents. It aims to play an open position after d2-d4 cxd4 very actively before White can develop and remove his king from the center. White should move with some caution."
31,4,Black,g3 b6,"Black chooses a kind of Queen's Indian Defense formation with an early ...c7-c5. By attempting to nullify White's Bg2 early-on Black should do alright. He's also kept Pd7 to keep Ke8 safe and to guard c6. Keeping those pawns (Pd7, Pe6, Pf7) on light squares can be very useful if Bc8 is traded off. If there is no early trade we might see those pawns move to other squares (...d7-d5 for example) ."
31,5,White,Bg2 Bb7,
31,6,Black,O-O Be7,
31,7,White,Re1 Ne4,"This is a nice response. Just get rid of the knight. White can't utilize the diagonal because ...Ne4xc3 hits White's queen. So, White would have to move Nc3 to avoid the trade and then try to exploit the exposed Ne4."
31,8,Black,Nxe4 Bxe4,"This continues the plan with no loss of time, but also without as much impact."
31,9,White,d3 Bb7,
31,10,Black,e4 O-O,"Vallejo Pons used the Pc4 & Pe4 formation in his game against Kasparov, so this isn't unfamiliar to him. Those pawns block both Bg2 and Bb7, so let's look at other factors to decide who is better or has a better continuation. With e4-e5 it's hard to see Black getting a grip on the dark squares with ...Nb8-c6, ...d7-d5, ...Be7-f6, but Black could challenge Pe4 more directly with ...d7-d5 or ...O-O and ...f7-f5. White will have to concede to pawn exchanges (else his central pawn structure would become broken) or to moving Nf3, so he can advance f2-f4. I'd favor Black, but that's just personal taste."
31,11,White,d4 cxd4,"This is an interesting change of tack. White opens things up, but he doesn't have the best grip on d5 since Nc3 is gone. Maybe now Black can play on the dark squares a little more actively."
31,12,Black,Nxd4 d6,
31,13,White,b3 a6,"White quickly moves everything off the f6-a1 diagonal, so now Black will have to open the position up."

31,19,White,g4 Nc5,
31,20,Black,b4 g6,"It appears Adams decided he might need that bishop for later duty, perhaps defending Pd6, and so he gives it a retreat square. Nc5 can only be captured if White is willing to lose Nd4 in return; the d-file would open and Nd4 would be pinned to Qd2."

31,31,White,f6 Ne5,This seems to nail the coffin shut on Kg8. How can Black get rid of Pf6 or move Bf8 to allow Kg8 to run away from the open h-file?

32,2,Black,Nf3 e6,
32,3,White,d4 cxd4,
32,4,Black,Nxd4 a6,"I don't recall Ivanchuk previously using this system against Kasparov. His flexibility with openings is shared by some other GMs, but few people truly play many defenses (or openings for White) with equal skill. There is simply too much specialized detail about most openings for this to be possible. Ivanchuk does better than most, but still has an occasional flub, as in the first round game of his FIDE wch match with Ponomariov."
32,5,White,c4 Nf6,"Wow, Kasparov sticks to the c2-c4 he used against Vallejo Pons of round 8."

32,11,White,Qxd4 d6,"Black's position isn't very enterprising. It's quite passive. He's traded off one minor piece, so his cramp won't be too terrible, but he will have to be in a mood to counter-attack if he's to find any chance to win."
32,12,Black,O-O Rb8,"Usually one wouldn't consider moving Pb7 when there's a Be2 to target Pa6, but Black has to be able to play ...b7-b6 to prevent c4-c5 and possibly to play ...b7-b5 (or ...b6-b5) to chop into White's central pawns, making more room for Black pieces to maneuver. Naturally White will make this more difficult."
32,13,White,Qb6 Qxb6,
32,14,Black,Bxb6 Bd7,
32,15,White,Rfd1 Rfc8,"preventing Bb6-c7xd6 and targeting Pc4. Kasparov isn't gaining much ground and without queens he won't have any king-side attack. Still, Black has no particular advantage (s) ."

32,17,White,Ba7 Ra8,
32,18,Black,Be3 Nd7,"It isn't obvious, but Black might be aiming for ...g7-g5 to secure square e5 for ...Nd7-e5. That would put a constant pressure on Pc4."
32,19,White,Na4 Rc6,
32,20,Black,f3 Kf8,"If White hadn't played Nc3-a4 Black's Nd7 could go to e5, but in this situation Na4-b6 hits Ra8 and guards Pc4. So, Black just keeps playing good position-improving moves."
32,21,White,Kf2 h6,
32,22,Black,g3 Rc7,"Enticing White to play Na4-b6 which would allow Black to trade off another minor piece. And, perhaps considering a move of Nd7 to discover an attack (by Be8) on Na4."

One obvious offensive idea is to double rooks on the d-file to threaten Pd6, but that's met by ...g7-g5 to chase Bf4 back. I suppose Kasparov just decided it wasn't worth the risk to try any major offensive thrust; so, he'll just wait for the next game and see what develops."

33,2,Black,c4 dxc4,
33,3,White,e4 Nf6,"This is more aggressive than 3. Nf3, but it also offers Black more choices for defense. Common responses are 3...c5, 3...e5 or 3...Nf6. All of them challenge White's central pawns immediately. There were a couple of these played in the FIDE wch match of Ivanchuk and Ponomariov. If White is allowed time to develop pieces to support his pawns then Black would have real problems. It's essential to know precisely what White's pawn formation is, so that Black's developments will be most effective. If White can keep his pawns as a duo they might advance in any fashion to foil Black's early developments."
33,4,Black,e5 Nd5,
33,5,White,Bxc4 Nb6,
33,6,Black,Bd3 Nc6,"Now Black knows not to fianchetto either bishop. Instead ...Bc8-e6-d5 followed by ...e7-e6, ...c7-c5 and ...Nb8-c6 would be coherent and apply terrific pressure to White's central pawns. Incidentally Pd4 isn't en prise because 6...Qxd4 is met decisively by 7. Bb5+."
33,7,White,Be3 Nb4,White's early pawn advances and Bishop developments creates a curious appearance and flaunts the classical rule of developing knights before bishops.
33,8,Black,Be4 f5,"Black too does some non-classical things: moving knights multiple times and now weakening Ke8 with ...f7-f5. It's often difficult to explain the rationale for such play. In this case Black can't get Bc8 developed as early as he'd like, so he uses Pf5 to control light squares. Black has to stake out control of the light squares to fix White's central pawns in place, then the assault on them would begin. This also explains why Black doesn't move ...Nb4-d5. He needs to leave open the possibility of ...c7-c5xd4, so control of d5 is sufficient; he doesn't have to occupy the square."
33,9,White,exf6 exf6,"This is a dramatic change of the landscape. White doesn't continue with the central pawns now that he's gained a concession (king's weakness) from Black. Now piece play can become prevalent. White would probably like to play Qd1-h5+, but he can't afford to until he's hobbled Nb4. It threatens to jump into c2 if White walks away from that square."
33,10,Black,Nc3 f5,Consistently Black uses a pawn to block Be4 and this incidentally (and usefully) prevents Qd1-h5+ from being effective. Now Nb4 could retreat if necessary.
33,11,White,Bb1 N4d5,
33,12,Black,Nf3 Bd6,It doesn't look like any stodgy closed Queen's Gambit Declined!
33,13,White,Bg5 Be7,"Black immediately moves the bishop again, but White has moved his bishop twice also. And, who should be concerned about how many times a piece has moved after all the other peculiar-looking maneuvers which preceded this? Most importantly Black threatens Bg5 and keeps Ke8 safe."
33,14,Black,Bd2 O-O,Now who's lost the tempo?
33,15,White,O-O Nxc3,
33,16,Black,bxc3 Be6,

33,18,Black,Bd3 Nc4,
33,19,White,Bxc4 Bxc4,"It's a sad day for White when he has to trade his good bishop for a lowly knight, and Black continues his light square control."
33,20,Black,Ne5 Bf7,
33,21,White,Nxf7 Rxf7,"Well, at least he gets the bishop back. This simplifies the game considerably and White's multiple pawn ""islands"" is balanced to some extent by Black's slightly weakened king's position."
33,22,Black,Qb3 c5,"Finally (!) , there's the crucial strike at Pd4. Of course it's different than if it had occurred early in the game. But, opening the position and getting rid of another White pawn will leave White with an isolated pawn, a much easier target. This is an example of attacking the pawn chain at it's head, Nimcovics (Nimzovitch) wouldn't have given this as an example of excellent play, but he also played such things."
33,23,White,d5 b5,Black has to prevent c3-c4 and in so doing offers a pawn trade which would give White a slightly better bishop (after 24. Qxb5 Qxd5 25. Bf4) if he can target Bc5 without ...f5-f4 chasing it off the e3-c5 diagonal.
33,24,Black,Re6 Qd7,"If Ponomariov had the White pieces he might well have played the same move. Both these players will go to extremes, at times, to gain the initiative for their pieces. In this case Black can work to isolate Pd5 and block Qb3 over on the queen-side, several tempi from the central action."

34,5,White,Nc3 b5,"Finally, someone chooses not to play c2-c4. However, 5. Bd3 is considered better by most people. Nc3 is a waiting target for ...b7-b5 or might be pinned by ...Bf8-b4. Black usually plays strongly on the dark squares, as in many Sicilian Defense variations, with White defending Nd4 & Nc3 and trying to find a way to open lines to Ke8 or make something of the half open d-file."
34,6,Black,Bd3 Bb7,Taking aim at Pe4 isn't going to succeed the way it would in many other variations. Here White has taken extra precaution to keep Pe4 safe and left Nd4 a little weaker. Black should adjust his play in recognition of this.
34,7,White,O-O Nc6,
34,8,Black,Nxc6 Bxc6,
34,9,White,Qe2 Ne7,"This takes care of the immediate threat, but also leaves Black's position awkward."

34,11,White,a4 b4,

34,13,White,c3 b3,
34,14,Black,g3 Bd6,"He's preparing Nd5-e3 and disallowing ...Ng6-f4. It's not terribly pretty, but Nd5 will have to move eventually."
34,15,White,Ne3 O-O,"For a position which has arisen from a Sicilian Defense this is very odd. The queen-side pawn formation is quite unusual and White's bishops on the d-file and Pg3 are peculiar. White should try to play on the d-file and perhaps try to win Pb3. He shouldn't allow Black to open the f-file with ...f7-f5. That would make Bc6 too good. So, Bd3-b5 to trade bishops might be useful. But, Pe4 needs defense, so Ne3 must move first."

34,23,White,e5 Qd5,

This looked as easy as Ivanchuk's victory and is more to be expected than the struggle Kasparov had to endure before gaining the full point against Vallejo Pons. It also puts Ponomariov right back into a tie for first with Kasparov. This sets up the climactic struggle between those two in the next round -- winner take all!"
35,1,White,d4 d5,
35,2,Black,Nf3 e6,"Is there much purpose to such a move or is he simply giving Ivanchuk something to think about, considering alternatives he might not have thought about during his pre-game preparations. Sometimes giving a person alternatives lets them go astray of their own accord."
35,3,White,g3 Nf6,"Since Pd5 will oppose White's Bf1 White will probably try c2-c4, but Black could still support Pd5 with ...c7-c6 (and Anand has played the Semi-Slav Defense) ."
35,4,Black,Bg2 Be7,
35,5,White,c4 O-O,After this Black is conceivably threatening to take Pc4 and hold onto it.
35,6,Black,Qc2 c5,"This is an attempt to show White hasn't put enough pressure on the center or developed quickly enough to avoid simplification. I wouldn't say this is a sharp attempt by Black to play for a win, though it is conceivable one would still win with the Black pieces. Pd5 is weaker than before, so cxd5 might loosen up Black's position a bit."

35,22,Black,e3 Nf5,
35,23,White, Qe1,"The mix of pieces is unusual and that complicates the task of both players. I wonder who offered the draw. I also find it interesting that Ivanchuk didn't make any headway against Ponomariov's Queen's Gambit Accepted or against Anand with the Catalan, where the basic idea of Black threatening to take and hold onto Pc4 is primary and for Black to play strongly with his pieces while Bg2 is (at least temporarily) blocked by Nf3 seems to give Black easy equality."
36,1,White,e4 c5,"Playing Adams in this tournament has been something akin to walking through a minefield. If Kasparov can get through unscathed he'll stay in the lead and get to the climactic matchup with Ponomariov in the next game. But, if he should lose he'll be the underdog in that big matchup. Adams or Shirov in the last round, could act as spoilers, but the fight is between Kasparov and Ponomariov."

36,7,White,Qf3 Nbd7,"Wow, now this is something interesting. I've seen a New In Chess magazine theoretical article on 6. Qf3 and played 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qf3, but I've never seen it played after 6. Be3. The idea is usually to allow O-O-O without having Qd2 blocking the d-file and to be able to meet ...e6-e5 with Nd4-f5 (and possibly ...g7-g6 with Nf5-e3, so putting Be3 seems odd. It's weakness is that it blocks Pf2 from immediately moving to f4, so that means Black can use square e5 or at least he doesn't have to worry much about e4-e5."
36,8,Black,Be2 h5,"Yes, it prevents g2-g4, but what does Ke8 have to say about it? Does he feel safer now? I think Adams would be happy to have another weakness he can play against, without having extended his own position; just so he doesn't lose Qf3 because of it's exposure."
36,9,White,Bg5 Qa5,threat: ...Qa5xg5 and possibly in some cases ...Nf6xe4
36,10,Black,Bd2 Qb6,Apparently he's willing to go to some length to not create any weaknesses Kasparov might utilize/exploit.
36,11,White,Nb3 Qc7,It would appear Black wants to play ...Nd7-e5-c4 or ...b7-b5 and ...Bc8-b7.
36,12,Black,a4 b6,"This move is slightly effective. It prevents ...b7-b5, so that after ...b7-b6 Pa6 will still need a defender. It also indicates White won't be castling to the queen-side and if he goes king-side one has to ask, ""Is Qf3 well placed?"""
36,13,White,Bg5 Bb7,"In many instances this freezes Nd7 as defender of Nf6. But, Black could spend a tempo on ...Bf8-e7 to take over that duty."
36,14,Black,Rd1 Be7,
36,15,White,Qe3 Nc5,"Adams is slowly rearranging his pieces to suit his needs in regard to playing against the slightly odd Black position. He might yet O-O and play f2-f4, but he is wisely repositioning his queen to prevent ...Nd7-c5 from being effective. Of course, that doesn't prevent ...Nd7-e5-c4."
36,16,Black,Nd2 Rd8,Why on earth is he avoiding that knight trade? Now Rd1 is blocked and Black can hardly be worse.
36,17,White,O-O Ng4,
36,18,Black,Bxg4 hxg4,"Kasparov was fully prepared to have his Ng4 captured. With or without that he was hitting Ph2, so that ...d6-d5 could clear the way for ...Qc7xh2#. He wasn't going to ...O-O anyway, so this just gives Rh8 a way to play. That Black gains the two bishops is probably incidental, but may prove useful later."
36,19,White,Bxe7 d5,
36,20,Black,Qg3 Qxg3,
36,21,White,fxg3 Kxe7,"And this is the result. Pe4 is en prise and Ph2 is very weak; if Black were to double rooks on the h-file it would probably fall. The open f-file isn't so bad for Black. He could play ...f7-f6 in a pinch, but Pg4 is quite weak. One Black advantage which could easily be overlooked is that his king is centralized and would be better in an endgame (I think the current situation is too complicated to be called an endgame and neither king would feel safe playing offensively) ."
36,22,Black,exd5 exd5,"This creates a small conundrum for Black. If he recaptures with the bishop to keep the d-file open he has to allow Nc3xd5, but a pawn recapture blocks Bb7."

38,9,White,Bb5 Bd6,
38,10,Black,Qg4 Kf8,"As in a Caro-Kann variation Black accepts that Pg7 is weak and must be defended this awkward way. However, Qg4 is exposed and Pd4 & Ne5 are ill-supported, so Black has plenty of chances to survive. Perhaps one of the more important details is that White needs to retreat Ne5 to avoid another minor piece exchange. The more exchanges the easier it will be for Black to complete his development and the harder it would be for White to generate an attack."
38,11,White,O-O Nxe5,"Kasparov has a lot of courage. Here he offers a pawn, so he can spend the tempo developing pieces. He obviously thinks there's a way to fight for a win if his piece activity is sufficient."

38,28,Black,a4 e4,"To this point Black has made nine pawn moves compared to White's four. Certainly the extra four moves could have been used by Black to keep his king safer and his pieces more active; but at the beginning it seemed so much easier. It's like watching a small snowball rolling down a hill, growing larger and faster as it goes."
38,29,White,axb5 axb5,
38,30,Black,Bxb5 Qe5,"Is there's still no way for Rh8 to move into play? Apparently Pc5 is too weak to spend any ""free"" tempos on general piece activation."

38,38,Black, Rxe6+,"The capture works after all. 38...Qxe6 allows 39. Qg7+ to win Rh8 and 38...Ke6 allows 39. Rd6+ which wins Qf6. This relentless attack wasn't so flashy as many, but it was very accurate and showed the pawns can't leave a king exposed without major consequences. In this case the defense was good, but the position was (apparently) irreparable. That the White pieces won this and the Adams-Anand games using this same (new to my knowledge) opening idea is notable. Anand didn't lose because of it, he misplayed a queen and pawn ending, but Ponomariov never quite recovered from the positional weaknesses around his king, created during the opening and early middle-game. Kasparov takes the lead in the tournament with only one round to go!"
39,1,White,e4 c5,
39,2,Black,Nf3 d6,
39,3,White,Bc4 Nf6,"I'm surprised to see this move. I'd been thinking about it and then saw a game GM Yudasin - IM Nakamura from a recent event and now here it is again. White's idea is to not commit to d2-d4 and to perhaps threaten c2-c3, d2-d4 when he's used Bc4 to prevent the counter ...d6-d5. Black can easily play ...Ng8-f6 or ...Nb8-c6, but he must realize White's possible plan to achieve d2-d4, else he'll have no offensive potential."
39,4,Black,d3 e6,Shirov aims to blunt the bishop and prepares ...d6-d5. He might also use ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5.

39,6,Black,O-O O-O,
39,7,White,c3 Nc6,
39,8,Black,Re1 b5,"He's over-protected Pe4, so Pd3 can advance. Black has a couple of choices after d3-d4. One is ...d6-d5 e4-e5 which produces a French Defense kind of pawn structure, but the early ...O-O might not be favorable. Another is ...e6-e5 which produces a Ruy Lopez kind of structure except Black hasn't weakened his queen-side (or gained space if that's a plan you prefer for Black) . Now that White has a Pc3 and couldn't utilize a weaker square d5 it might be good for Black to play 8...e6-e5 in anticipation of 9. d3-d4 Bg4."
39,9,White,Nbd2 d5,
39,10,Black,e5 Nd7,
39,11,White,d4 Ba6,I wonder if later he might miss this piece from c8 where it could defend Pe6 in a few critical cases when Black would want to play ...f7-f5 to block the b1-h7 diagonal.

39,14,Black,Bxc6 Rxc6,
39,15,White,cxb4 Bxf1,
39,16,Black,Rxf1 cxb4,This certainly solves a lot of Black's problems. Kg8 is a lot safer and Black already has control of the only open file (Rc8) . By trading a couple of minor pieces it should also be easier for Black to maneuver comfortably.

39,29,White,Bg5 b3,
39,30,Black,Rfb1 Rb8,This is a tense phase where White has to bring every single piece into play and yet prevent Pb3 from advancing very far.

40,1,White,e4 e5,"After seeing the Sicilian Defense so many times it's quite a curious thing to see this recent trend (at least amongst the top-level GMs) toward 1. e4 e5 with both the Petrov's Defense and 2. Nf3 Nc6 being played. The so-called hypermodern defenses have been relegated to the back-burner. I haven't seen a Modern/Pirc or Alekhine's Defense game for a long time.

Of course, it goes through ups and downs as people play it, discover problems, study it and then play it again. Perhaps it's just that other defenses seem to have a few more adherents than this one, so that the ups and downs of some Sicilian Defense or Queen's Gambit variation is hardly noticed. One must remember also, there are many variations of a Spanish and this is but one."

40,16,Black,Qe2 f5,"In Ponomariov-Adams from round 9 Ponomariov established Re4 as a perimeter and offered for Black to capture it with a minor piece. He also played f2-f3 to support that perimeter. As a result his king was weakened a bit, but Black didn't quite break through and was pushed back. In this game Anand is using a pawn to challenge Re4, so this game ought to have a different appearance and the clash might occur more on Black's terms."
40,17,White,Bxd5+ cxd5,I'm not quite certain why he chose this moment to get rid of Nd5.

40,28,Black, Rxd5,So Ponomariov hangs on to the draw and second place -- not a bad debut to the most prestigious tournament (some say world championship of tournaments) in the world.
41,1,White,e4 c5,"At this point in the tournament Shirov has drawn with everyone but Adams and has beaten Ivanchuk (3rd-5th place finish) , but lost (with Black) to Anand, Adams and Vallejo Pons (3rd-5th and 6th place finishers) . This is an odd sort of result except that each and every one of these contestants is very strong. One gets the sense Shirov is trying to figure out how to beat the top players and this tournament was (for Shirov) as much for experimentation as anything; or maybe he's just in a bit of a slump."
41,2,Black,Nf3 Nc6,"Already this is a surprise. I can't recall the last time Kasparov played this. Here are some of his ""surprises"" from the tournament: round 1 as Black against Vallejo Pons' English Opening he played 2...e5; round 8 as White against Vallejo Pons' Sicilian Defense he played c2-c4 to establish a Maroczy Bind; round 7 against Shirov's Sicilian Defense he played 3. Bb5 and, now in this Sicilian Defense game against Shirov he has played 2...Nc6."
41,3,White,d4 cxd4,
41,4,Black,Nxd4 Nf6,
41,5,White,Nc3 e5,"I don't recall ever seeing Kasparov play this. And, why would he play such a double-edged opening when all he needs is a draw to win the tournament. He risks a lot with this choice because a loss here and a win by Ponomariov would give Ponomariov a tie for first with Kasparov."

41,10,Black,Nd5 f5,
41,11,White,Bxb5 axb5,"This isn't unknown, but it is uncommon. There aren't so many players who wish to enter into a tactical melee this quickly. The strategic idea is that White's bishop isn't very good and this way it gives it's life to make Na3 very good and to open some lines to Ke8, so it will never find a safe haven."
41,12,Black,Nxb5 Ra4,threat: Nc7+
41,13,White,b4 Qh4,"Black enters the attack vs. counterattack situation and makes room at d8 for Black's king to move around a bit. The center is clogged up, so he plays with Ra4 and Qh4 on the wings."
41,14,Black,O-O Rg8,"White might like to think his king is safe behind the pawns, but there's room for Black to play on that wing and the g-file is open. It's still anybody's game."
41,15,White,f4 Kd8,This ugly-duckling move allows Qh4 to move without Nd5-f6+ picking up Rg8.
41,16,Black,c3 Ra6,"If you'd shown me this game without telling me who was playing I might have guessed Shirov, as he plays this Bxb5 variation occasionally, but I'd never have guessed Kasparov would play this variation. I'm not saying it's bad (I don't know about that) , just that it doesn't seem to be his usual style."
41,17,White,a4 fxe4,
41,18,Black,f5 Bb7,
41,19,White,Ra2 e3,"This isn't exactly ""playing in the center"" so much as getting out of the way of Bb7, so he can play on the wing at g2."

41,27,White,Qxe3 Qd4,
41,28,Black,Qc1 Qd5,"Black pieces are perfect for offense at d2 and along the d-file AND he defends Kd8 and against the advance of Pa5 very well. White has no hope. I don't know the opening theory of this game, but it appears to me Kasparov out-dueled Shirov in his own ""pet"" line. Bravo! This tops a fine tournament victory as well."
42,1,White,e4 c5,"Adams and Ivanchuk both, with a victory in this game, would tie for second place."
42,2,Black,Nf3 e6,
42,3,White,d4 cxd4,
42,4,Black,Nxd4 a6,
42,5,White,Bd3 Nf6,"After Kasparov and Ponomariov used c2-c4 Anand used Nb1-c3, but Bf1-d3 (Kan Variation) , used by Ivanchuk in round 10 (he also followed with c2-c4 after he'd castled) , is supposed to be the ""main line"". White prepares to O-O and keeps open the option of c2-c4."
42,6,Black,O-O d6,This is typical of a Paulsen Variation. Black leaves open his specific piece development and just uses pawn moves early-on to limit White's pieces. The down-side of this approach is that it's not very contentious and allows White to choose his set-up.
42,7,White,c4 b6,"Hedgehog - Also see Ivanchuk-VallejoPons, round 10, 1-0 in 23 where 7...Be7 was played."
42,8,Black,Nc3 Bb7,
42,9,White,f4 Be7,Adams plays as though he had Pc2 rather than Pc4. This tells me he considers having Pc4 as an unqualified advantage which requires no limitation on how he might otherwise play the position. Ivanchuk did the same when he played the White pieces.
42,10,Black,f5 Nc6,Black takes the pressure off Pe6 immediately. Black can hardly afford to play ...e6-e5 and leave Pd5 completely in White's hands.
42,11,White,Be3 Nxd4,"getting rid of the pressure on Pe6, so he doesn't have to play ...e6-e5 which weakens d5"
42,12,Black,Bxd4 O-O,
42,13,White,fxe6 fxe6,
42,14,Black,Qe2 Kh8,White may attack Pb6 to peck away at Black's weak points while he maneuvers into some formation to attack Kg8. Threatening at two or three points can help the White cause.
42,15,White,Rad1 Nd7,
42,16,Black,Rxf8+ Qxf8,"Adams saw that Rf1 had no great offensive value if it was always going to be traded for Rf8, so he forced the trade on his terms. This way Rd1 continues to take aim at Pd6 & Qd8 and the rook trade forces at least one Black piece onto an awkward square (f8) ."
42,17,White,Na4 Bf6,This simple attack on Pb6 puts Black's position into crisis!
42,18,Black,Bxf6 Qxf6,
42,19,White,Qe3 Rd8,"defending Nd7, so he can meet 20. Nxb6 with 20...Qxb2. Swapping pawns is better than just losing Pb6."

42,21,White,Nxb6 axb4,

42,36,Black,Rxe6 h5,There's the completion of the pawn exchange. Now White has an extra pawn and Black has a slightly weak doubled h-file pawn. Black's saving grace is the small number of pieces and that Kh3 is tied to Ph2.
