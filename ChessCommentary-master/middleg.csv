is very bad, since three of his pawns are fixed on his own colour. But thanks
to the fact that the Bishop is outside the pawn chain and posted on a square

quite obvioius that in playing for an attack, the first requirement is to get
a file open for the Rooks; but this creates it's own problems. Any attempt to
follow the advance given earlier in this chapter - not to embark on a flank
attack until the centre is closed - would in the present case run into trouble,

in such position, for it enables White to start a minority attack on the
Queenside. The present position, however, is an exception which provides us
with a welcome chance of giving a warning against superficial thinking. How is
it that the minority attack give White such a promising initative in many
variations of the QGD? The reason must be that the Pb4-b5 of the minority
attack is a means of breaking the half-open c-file fully open. But this is not
the whole explanation. The essential point is that Black, who has the
half-open e-file, cannot be so prompt with his counterattack. His thematic
advance is ... Pf5-f4, and this need preparation. Preparation however needs
time, and White can use this time to push forward his b-pawn without delay.  
 In light of these considerations the difference between the present diagram
and the normal QG positions, in which the minority attack has legitimate
expectations of success, is clear enough. Black has already played ... Pf5 and
so will probably be able to play ... Pf4 before White can play Pb5 on the

well aware of the fact that Janowsky was a great advocate of the two Bishops.

better he thought he had a won game, if he had some considerable advantage he
confidently expected his oponent to strike his colours. All of Lasker's
fighting instincts have been aroused by his somewhat unfavourable opening. He
has volutarily conceded the two Bishops to his opponent, prevented any

uncomfortable when having to defend. As a rule the player who had won one or
more pawns tried stubbornly to hold on to them, arguing that if he could parry
the enemy attack without conceding any material his advantage woud give him a
certain win in the ending. Before the endgame the gods have placed the
middlegame as Dr Tarrasch used to preach in those days. What he meant by that

- brand new at the time - which Black applies here is in general a good remedy
for all gambits. It is just this willingness to return the material won
whenever seems proper which has damped the enthusiasm of today's players. This

occasionally happens to all of us. At times like this we know we are likely to
make wrong decisions at critical moments, and for want of inspiration it is
only natural to make exchanges automatically .Such must have been the

ation suggests a Queenside attack by White based on Pb4 and eventually Pc5.
Black's plan, on the other hand, should be the advance of ... Pf5, with
Kingside attacking chances."
424,14,Black,f4 exf4,"This advance is normally
anti-positional since after ... exf4 Black obtains a strong outpost square on
e5 and the half-open e-file with which to press on the now backward e-pawn.
However, this position is exceptional in that White can ""get away"" with the
usually anti-positional advance Pf4. This is because he will obtain strong
pressure on the newly opened f-file, whic, in conjunction with the
concentration of his minor pieces on or near the Black Kingside, will provide
enough pressure to compensate for the aforementioned positional liabilities.
In this game Tartakower utilizes these factors well, until a critical moment
when he misses a chance for a double exchange sacrifice which would have
forced Black to work hard to achieve a draw. Having missed his chance he winds
up in a seriously compromised position, which Lasker quickly exploits to his
advantage"
424,15,White,Bxf4 Nxf4,
424,16,Black,Rxf4 Be7,"Showing a very
fine positional sense. The weakening of e5, consequent to the advance 14. Pf4,
has givven Black the chance to occupy the outpost at e5. The purpose of the
text move is to prepare to occupy e5 by a coordinated sequence of moves.
Incidentally, the text also prevents the possibility of White pushing Pe4-e5"

sacrifice would have maintained the pressure and force Black to defend
resourcefully to hold the game"

478,33,White,Nd2 e4,"To give some idea of Tarrasch's style of analysis and clarity with which he
could set out the essentials of the position, we give here his note on this
position:  ""Black has far and away the better game. As regards material it is
quite likely in the endgame a Rook and two Bishops will turn out to be
stronger than Rooks and a Knight; furthermore the b-pawn is bound to fall.
Black's centre is very strong, and teh advance of the d-pawn and c-pawn will
produce a pair of united passed pawns. White is still uncastled, and Black can
play to preven Kingside castling by ... Ra8 and ... Ba6. The White Rooks have
not a single open file at their disposal, and the Knight is pinned. In reality
White has only his Queen in play.  It is now up to Black to utilize his
chances tactically. The simplest way thought perhaps not the best, would be ...
Qc5 followed by ... Qxb6 and then advance the c-pawn. Black plays however to
prevent castling, to deprive the opponent of all good moves, to force all his
pieces - especially Knight - to unfavourable positions and finally reduce him
to desparation"
