1,1,White,e4 e5,"In my preparation to this tournament, I (and probably everybody else) paid the most serious attention to two openingsx Ruy Lopez with Bc5 and Najdorf, since most of the participants seem to play them both. Needless to say, refuting Najdorf is tough, but I thought I came close to refuting Ruy Lopez with 5...b5 and 6...Bc5, provided Black responded to 7.a4 with 7...Rb8. But the opening ceremony dealt a heavy blow to mex I was the last one to play Shirov with White. And indeed, in Rounds 7&8 Shirov faced the position after 7.a4 against Kasparov & Anand. But to my relief, he must have thought that these guys know something and replied 7...Bb7. I was still in business."

1,5,White,O-O b5,
1,6,Black,Bb3 Bc5,
1,7,White,a4 Rb8,"Played without hesitation, as I and Nigel correctly guessed he wouldx his 7...Bb7 was not broken, but quite bent in the game vs Vishy, and also I probably don't give the impression of a man capable to prepare anything at all."

1,10,Black,Na3 Bg4,
1,11,White,axb5 axb5,
1,12,Black,Nxb5 O-O,"One of the strangest tabyias of modern times. Black is a pawn down and is prepared to take on f3, strengthening White's centre and giving him the advantage of two Bishops."
1,13,White,Re1 Bxf3,"This position saw also 13.Bc2 and 13.Be3, but Black is doing relatively fine there."
1,14,Black,gxf3 Nh5,"Shirov is repeating his game vs Ivanchuk from Belgrade, where he had no problems whatsoever."
1,15,White,Kh1 Qf6,Played very quickly again. Other moves arex
1,16,Black,Rg1 Nf4,Winning an important tempo.
1,17,White,Be3 Ne6,The only possible source of counterplay.
1,18,Black,Bxe6 fxe6,
1,19,White,Rg3 Kh8,A good prophylactic move
1,20,Black,Qd3 exd4,"This move does not spoil anything, but it was probably better to play 20.Rc1, and Black is left with almost no counterplay at all."
1,21,White,cxd4 e5,
1,22,Black,d5 Ne7,"Here I spent half an hour calculating this position to the end, and played"
1,23,White,Bxb6 Rxb6,
1,24,Black,Nxc7 Rxb2,
1,25,White,Ne6 Rg8,
1,26,Black,Kg1 Ng6,"Many other ideas are tempting, but this is the best. White chases away the enemy rook and then goes on the offensive."
1,27,White,Qa3 Rb6,
1,28,Black,Kh1 Nf4,The point. White is perfectly coordinated and is ready to tie Black completely with 29.Rag1.
1,29,White,Nxg7 Ne2,
1,30,Black,Nf5 Rgb8,"That's what Alexei probably missed. White has no intention of protecting the exchange - once Black take on g3, the game will be over."
1,31,White,Qd3 Rb2,
1,32,Black,Rf1 Ra8,"Probably something like 32.Rg4 was winning also, but this move is better- Black will be forced to take on g3 quite soon."
1,33,White,Qc4 Nxg3+,
1,34,Black,hxg3 Qd8,White is now winning easily.

I studied chess at the Leningrad Pioneers' Palace (subscribers of the ""New in Chess"" Magazine could feel its atmosphere with the help of the remarkable essay of Genna Sosonko, dedicated to Vladimir Zak [""A great teacher inspires"" - see NIC 99/5]). A very experienced master Sergey Khavsky was my coach (by the way, a well-known St.Petersburg grandmaster Vladimir Epishin, living now in Germany, was one of his students). 
Well, master Khavsky inculcated us steadfast disgust for moves like g2-g4 and g7-g5, especially when one makes them at the open position or having a king unprovided for. He often said that ""the only case to play g2-g4 is when you win at least a piece"". We even invented a special term for such a move - ""the anti-Khavsky move"". Accordingly, when an opponent resorts to the move, I feel an insuperable desire to ""punish"" him for this untimely activity and permanently tell myself that ""a pawn doesn't advance back"" and that ""the position weakening must adversaly affect early or late""."
